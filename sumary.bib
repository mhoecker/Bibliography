  abstract  = {Accurate and computationally-efficient modeling of stratified mixing processes are of paramount importance in both coastal and large-scale ocean circulation. In this study, our main objective is to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of large eddy simulation (LES) as a possible tool to study small-scale oceanic processes. To this end, LES is evaluated in a 3D lock-exchange problem, which contains shear-driven mixing, internal waves, interactions with boundaries and convective motions, while having a simple domain, initial and boundary conditions, and forcing. Two general classes of LES models are tested, namely eddy viscosity (EV) models based on constant-coefficient and dynamic Smagorinsky models, and an approximate deconvolution (AD) model. By noting that the dynamic Smagorinsky and AD models have different strengths in that the former is good in providing appropriate dissipation while the latter in preserving the detail of coherent structures on coarse resolution meshes, a hybrid approach combining EV and AD models is also evaluated. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) is performed as the benchmark solution, and all LES models are tested on three coarse meshes. The main measure of mixing is taken as the temporal evolution of background potential energy. It is found that constant-coefficient Smagorinsky models can only provide a marginal improvement over under-resolved simulations, while both dynamic Smagorinsky and AD models lead to significant improvements in mixing accuracy. The primary accomplishment of this study is that it is shown that the hybrid approach attains the best agreement with the mixing curve from DNS, while being computationally approximately a thousand times faster.},

  abstract  = {Ocean overturning circulation requires a continuous thermody-namic transformation of the buoyancy of seawater. The steeply sloping isopycnals of the Southern Ocean provide a pathway for Circumpolar Deep Water to upwell from mid depth without strong diapycnal mixing1-3, where it is transformed directly by surface fluxes of heat and freshwater and splits into an upper and lower branch4-6. While brine rejection from sea ice is thought to contribute to the lower branch7, the role of sea ice in the upper branch is less well understood, partly due to a paucity of observations of sea-ice thickness and transport8,9. Here we quantify the sea-ice freshwater flux using the Southern Ocean State Estimate, a state-of-the-art data assimilation that incorporates millions of ocean and ice observations. We then use the water-mass transformation framework10 to compare the relative roles of atmospheric, sea-ice, and glacial freshwater fluxes, heat fluxes, and upper-ocean mixing in transforming buoyancy within the upper branch. We find that sea ice is a dominant term, with di erential brine rejection and ice melt transforming upwelled Circumpolar Deep Water at a rate of ~22 x 106 m3 s-1 . These results imply a prominent role for Antarctic sea ice in the upper branch and suggest that residual overturning and wind-driven sea-ice transport are tightly coupled.},

  abstract  = {Ocean waves are complex and often turbulent. While most ocean-wave interactions are essentially linear, sometimes two or more waves interact in a nonlinear way. For example, two or more waves can interact and yield waves that are much taller than the sum of the original wave heights. Most of these shallow-water nonlinear interactions look like an X or a Y or two connected Ys; at other times, several lines appear on each side of the interaction region. It was thought that such nonlinear interactions are rare events: they are not. Here we report that such nonlinear interactions occur every day, close to low tide, on two flat beaches that are about 2000 km apart. These interactions are closely related to the analytic, soliton solutions of a widely studied multidimensional nonlinear wave equation. On a much larger scale, tsunami waves can merge in similar ways.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a new series of numerical simulations of stratified flow over local- ized topography which has been designed to address issues arising from a recently
published sequence of detailed observations from a coastal oceanographic setting. Results demonstrate that the numerically simulated flow is very similar to that which
develops in Knight Inlet, British Columbia, a fjord which is subject to periodic tidal forcing, and that the detailed dynamical characteristics of this flow are also strikingly similar to those of severe downslope windstorms that often occur in the atmosphere. A typical sequence of events observed in such flows includes the 'breaking' of a forced stationary internal wave induced by the topography, which results in irreversible mix- ing and the formation, through wave-mean flow interaction, of a decelerated mixed layer that extends downstream from the level of breaking. The formation of this mixed layer is a necessary precondition for transition of the flow into a supercriti- cal hydraulic regime in which a low-level high-velocity jet develops in the lee of the topographic maximum. Simulations with both fixed inflow velocity and harmoni- cally varying inflow velocity are performed and intercomparison of the results clearly demonstrates that flow evolution in the unsteady forcing case can be described, to reasonable approximation, by the results of the corresponding quasi-steady simula- tions, at least during the accelerating stage when inflow velocity is slowly increasing. At later times of flow evolution, however, the well-mixed fluid accumulates and the flow enters a statistically steady hydraulic-like regime which is characterized by a constant mean drag exerted by the topography on the flow even while the inflow velocity slowly decreases.},

great importance for increasing control over heat transfer in high power density systems
utilizing boiling phenomena. They also provide an elegant means to direct droplet motion
in a variety of recently emerging fluidic systems. Here, we report the fabrication and
characterization of tilted nanopillar arrays (TNPAs) that exhibit directional Leidenfrost
water droplets under dynamic conditions, namely on impact with Weber numbers g40 at
T g 325  C. The directionality for these droplets is opposite to the direction previously
exhibited by macro- and microscale Leidenfrost ratchets where movement against the tilt of the ratchet was observed. The batch fabrication of the TNPAs was achieved by glancing-angle anisotropic reactive ion etching of a thermally dewet platinum mask, with mean pillar diameters of 100 nm and heights of 200 500 nm. In contrast to previously implemented macro- and microscopic Leidenfrost ratchets, our TNPAs induce no preferential directional movement of Leidenfrost droplets under conditions approaching steady-state film boiling, suggesting that the observed droplet directionality is not a result of the widely accepted mechanism of asymmetric vapor flow. Using high-speed imaging, phase diagrams were constructed for the boiling behavior upon impact for droplets falling onto TNPAs, straight nanopillar arrays, and smooth silicon surfaces. The asymmetric impact and directional trajectory of droplets was exclusive to the TNPAs for impacts corresponding to the transition boiling regime, linking asymmetric surface wettability to preferential directionality of dynamic Leidenfrost droplets on nanostructured surfaces.},

  pages     = {289--317},
  abstract  = {The breaking of fully nonlinear internal solitary waves of depression shoaling upon a uniformly sloping boundary in a smoothed two-layer density field was investigated using high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. Our simulations were limited to narrow-crested waves, which are more common than broad-crested waves in geophysical flows. The simulations were performed for a wide range of boundary slopes S {$\in$} [0.01, 0.3] and wave slopes extending the parameter range to weaker slopes than considered in previous laboratory and numerical studies. Over steep slopes (Sb0.1), three distinct breaking processes were observed: surging, plunging and collapsing breakers which are associated with reflection, convective instability and boundary-layer separation, respectively. Over mild slopes (ST0.05), nonlinearity varies gradually and the wave fissions into a train of waves of elevation as it passes through the turning point where solitary waves reverse polarity. The dynamics of each breaker type were investigated and the predominance of a particular mechanism was associated with a relative developmental time scale. The breaking location was modelled as a function of wave amplitude (a), characteristic wave length and the isopycnal length along the slope. The breaker type was characterized in wave slope (Sw =a/Lw, where Lw is a measure of half of the wavelength) versus S space, and the reflection coefficient (R), modelled as a function of the internal Iribarren number, was in agreement with other studies. The effects of grid resolution and wave Reynolds number (Rew) on R, boundary-layer separation and the evolution of global instability were studied. High Reynolds numbers (Rew ~ 104) were found to trigger a global instability, which modifies the breaking process relative to the lower Rew case, but not necessarily the breaking location, and results in a ~ 10 % increase in R, relative to the Rew ~ 103 case.},

  volume    = {690},
  pages     = {321--344},
  abstract  = {We investigate global instability and vortex shedding in the separated laminar boundary layer beneath internal solitary waves (ISWs) of depression in a two-layer stratified fluid by performing high-resolution two-dimensional direct numerical simulations. The simulations were conducted with waves propagating over a flat bottom and shoaling over relatively mild  and steep  slopes. Over a flat bottom, the potential for vortex shedding is shown to be directly dependent on wave amplitude, for a particular stratification, owing to increase of the adverse pressure gradient ( for leftward propagating waves) beneath the trailing edge of larger amplitude waves. The generated eddies can ascend from the bottom boundary to as high as 33 % of the total depth in two-dimensional simulations. Over sloping boundaries, global instability occurs beneath all waves as they steepen. For the slopes considered, vortex shedding begins before wave breaking and the vortices, shed from the bottom boundary, can reach the pycnocline, modifying the wave breaking mechanism. Combining the results over flat and sloping boundaries, a unified criterion for vortex shedding in arbitrary two-layer continuous stratifications is proposed, which depends on the momentum-thickness Reynolds number and the non-dimensionalized ISW-induced pressure gradient at the point of separation. The criterion is generalized to a form that may be readily computed from field data and compared to published laboratory experiments and field observations. During vortex shedding events, the bed shear stress, vertical velocity and near-bed Reynolds stress were elevated, in agreement with laboratory observations during re-suspension events, indicating that boundary layer instability is an important mechanism leading to sediment re-suspension.},

For low values of the excitation frequency, linear theory well predicts the internal wave frequencies but significantly overestimates the wave amplitudes because it neglects processes associated with boundary layer separation. When the excitation frequency exceeds the buoyancy frequency, turbulence results in the excitation of internal waves with frequencies approximately 0.72{$\pm$}0.05 of the buoyancy frequency and vertical displacement amplitudes ranging between 1.5% and 2% of the horizontal
wavelength.},

  abstract  = {Phytoplankton blooms over Arctic Ocean continental shelves are thought to be restricted to waters free of sea ice. Here, we document a massive phytoplankton bloom beneath fully consolidated pack ice far from the ice edge in the Chukchi Sea, where light transmission has increased in recent decades because of thinning ice cover and proliferation of melt ponds. The bloom was characterized by high diatom biomass and rates of growth and primary production. Evidence suggests that under-ice phytoplankton blooms may be more widespread over nutrient-rich Arctic continental shelves and that satellite-based estimates of annual primary production in these waters may be underestimated by up to 10-fold.},

  abstract  = {Collective decision-making in biological systems requires all individuals in the group to go through a behavioural change of state. During this transition fast and robust transfer of information is essential to prevent cohesion loss. The mechanism by which natural groups achieve such robustness, however, is not clear. Here we present an experimental study of starling flocks performing collective turns. We find that information about direction changes propagates across the flock with a linear dispersion law and negligible attenuation, hence minimizing group decoherence. These results contrast starkly with present models of collective motion, which predict diffusive transport of information. Building on spontaneous symmetry breaking and conservation-law arguments, we formulate a theory that correctly reproduces linear and undamped propagation. Essential to this framework is the inclusion of the birds/' behavioural inertia. The theory not only explains the data, but also predicts that information transfer must be faster the stronger the group/'s orientational order, a prediction accurately verified by the data. Our results suggest that swift decision-making may be the adaptive drive for the strong behavioural polarization observed in many living groups.},

  abstract = { ABSTRACT The interaction of tidal currents with sea-floor topography results in the radiation of internal gravity waves into the ocean interior. These waves are called internal tides and their dissipation due to nonlinear wave breaking and concomitant three-dimensional turbulence could play an important role in the mixing of the abyssal ocean, and hence in controlling the large-scale ocean circulation.As part of on-going work aimed at providing a theory for the vertical distribution of wave breaking over sea-floor topography, in this paper we investigate the instability of internal tides in a very simple linear model that helps us to relate the formation of unstable regions to simple features in the sea-floor topography. For two-dimensional tides over one-dimensional topography we find that the formation of overturning instabilities is closely linked to the singularities in the topography shape and that it is possible to have stable waves at the sea floor and unstable waves in the ocean interior above.For three-dimensional tides over two-dimensional topography there is in addition an effect of geometric focusing of wave energy into localized regions of high wave amplitude, and we investigate this focusing effect in simple examples. Overall, we find that the distribution of unstable wave breaking regions can be highly non-uniform even for very simple idealized topography shapes. },

  abstract = {Two-dimensional and Three-dimensional turbulence have different properties, but both contain the two basic ingredients of randomness and convective nonlinearity, and some of the statistical hypotheses which have been proposed for three?dimensional turbulence should be applicable to two?dimensional motion. This justifies a numerical integration of the unaveraged equations of motion in two dimensions with random initial conditions as a means of testing the soundness of ideas such as those leading to the Kolmogoroff equilibrium theory. In spatially homogeneous two?dimensional turbulence, the mean?square vorticity is unaffected by convection and can only decrease under the action of viscosity. Consequently the rate of dissipation of energy tends to zero with the viscosity (v) . On the other hand, the mean square vorticity gradient is increased by convective mixing, and it seems likely that the rate of decrease of mean square vorticity tends to a nonzero limit as 0 . This suggests the existence of a  cascade of mean?square vorticity at large Reynolds number, and an?equilibrium range? in the vorticity spectrum determined by the parameters and alone to which familiar dimensional arguments can be applied. Also, the energy and vorticity?containing components presumably settle down to an approximate similarity state determined by the total energy alone. A numerical integration of the equation of motion to test such similarity relations was attempted at Cambridge some years ago by R. W. Bray. The velocity distribution was represented by spectral lines at vector wavenumbers of the form (p,q) , where p and q are integers and (p2+q2)1/2<10 , and the integration was carried out to times at which an appreciable amount of vorticity had been transferred to the larger wavenumbers. The results obtained with the rather small computing machine available at the time were not decisive, but they were consistent with the development of the expected k 1 form of the vorticity spectrum.},

However, persistent cloud cover, periods of constant night and prevailing low solar elevations in polar regions severely limit traditional passive satellite ocean colour measurements and leave vast areas unobserved for many consecutive months each year. Consequently, our understanding of the annual cycles of polar plankton and their interannual variations is incomplete. Here we use space-borne lidar observations to overcome the limitations of historical passive sensors and report a decade of uninterrupted polar phytoplankton biomass cycles. We find that polar phytoplankton dynamics are categorized by /`boom-bust/' cycles resulting from slight imbalances in plankton predator-prey equilibria. The observed seasonal-to-interannual variations in biomass are predicted by mathematically modelled rates of change in phytoplankton division. Furthermore, we find that changes in ice cover dominated variability in Antarctic phytoplankton stocks over the past decade, whereas ecological processes were the predominant drivers of change in the Arctic. We conclude that subtle and environmentally driven imbalances in polar food webs underlie annual phytoplankton boom-bust cycles, which vary interannually at each pole.},

  abstract = {The turbulent mixing in thin ocean surface boundary layers (OSBL), which occupy the upper 100m or so of the ocean, control the exchange of heat and trace gases between the atmosphere and ocean. Here we show that current parameterizations of this turbulent mixing lead to systematic and substantial errors in the depth of the OSBL in global climate models, which then leads to biases in sea surface temperature. One reason, we argue, is that current parameterizations are missing key surface-wave processes that force Langmuir turbulence that deepens the OSBL more rapidly than steady wind forcing. Scaling arguments are presented to identify two dimensionless parameters that measure the importance of wave forcing against wind forcing, and against buoyancy forcing. A global perspective on the occurrence of wave-forced turbulence is developed using re-analysis data to compute these parameters globally. The diagnostic study developed here suggests that turbulent energy available for mixing the OSBL is under-estimated without forcing by surface waves. Wave-forcing and hence Langmuir turbulence could be important over wide areas of the ocean and in all seasons in the Southern Ocean. We conclude that surface-wave-forced Langmuir turbulence is an important process in the OSBL that requires parameterization.},

In August of 2012, a workshop was held under the umbrella of the {\{GEOHAB\}} program at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). The over arching goal of this workshop was to review the current understanding of the processes governing the structure and dynamics of {\{HABs\}} in stratified systems, and to identify how best to couple physical/chemical and biological measurements at appropriate spatial and temporal scales to quantify the dynamics of {\{HABs\}} in these systems, paying particular attention to thin layers. This contribution provides a review of recent progress in the field of {\{HAB\}} research in stratified systems including thin layers, and identifies the gaps in knowledge that our scientific community should strive to understand in the next decade. },

  abstract = {The thermohaline structure across the tidal fronts of the continental shelf off Patagonia is analyzed using historical and recent summer hydrographic sections. The near-summer tidal front location is determined on the basis of the magnitude of vertical stratification of the water column as measured by the Simpson parameter. Sea surface and air CO2 partial pressures based on data from eleven transects collected in summer and fall from 2000 to 2004 are used to estimate CO2 fluxes over the shelf. The near-shore waters are a source of CO2 to the atmosphere while the midshelf region is a CO2 sink. The transition between source and sink regions closely follows the location of tidal fronts, suggesting a link between vertical stratification of the water column and the regional CO2 balance. The highest surface values of Chl a are associated with the strongest CO2 sinks. The colocation of lowest CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) and highest Chl a suggests that phytoplankton blooms on the stratified side of the fronts draw the ocean's CO2 to very low levels. The mean shelf sea-air difference in pCO2 (pCO2) is 24 atm and rises to 29 atm if the shelf break front is included. Peaks in pCO2 of 110 atm, among the highest observed in the global ocean, are observed. The estimated summer mean CO2 flux over the shelf is 4.4 mmol m2 d1 and rises to 5.7 mmol m2 d1 when the shelf break area is taken into account. Thus, during the warm season the shelf off Patagonia is a significant atmospheric CO2 sink.},

  abstract = {A new method is introduced for determining ocean isothermal layer depth (ILD) from temperature profiles and ocean mixed layer depth (MLD) from density profiles that can be applied in all regions of the world's oceans. This method can accommodate not only in situ data but also climatological data sets that typically have much lower vertical resolution. The sensitivity of the ILD and MLD to the temperature difference criteria used in the surface layer depth definition is discussed by using temperature and density data, respectively: (1) from 11 ocean weather stations in the northeast Pacific and (2) from the World Ocean Atlas 1994. Using these two data sets, a detailed statistical error analysis is presented for the ILD and MLD estimation by season. MLD variations with location due to temperature and salinity are properly accounted for in the defining density ({$\Delta_\sigma_t$}) criterion. Overall, the optimal estimate of turbulent mixing penetration is obtained using a MLD definition of {$\Delta$}T =0.8{$\deg$}0, although in the northeast Pacific region the optimal MLD criterion is found to vary seasonally. The method is shown to produce layer depths that are accurate to within 20 m or better in 85% or more of the cases. The MLD definition presented in this investigation accurately represents the depth to which turbulent mixing has penetrated and would be a useful aid for validation of one-dimensional bulk mixed layer models and ocean general circulation models with an embedded mixed layer.},

  abstract = {In order to understand the daily cycle of heat storage within the surface mixed layer it is necessary to distinguish between the mixed layer, the zone of relatively homogeneous water formed by the history of mixing, and the mixing layer, the zone in which mixing is currently active. We compare surface layer definitions based on density (or temperature) with turbulence measurements to evaluate their skill in finding mixed and mixing layer depths, using definitions based on density increase from the surface, and on density gradients. Both types of definition are capable of finding the mixed layer depth, with some tuning for local conditions. Neither definition, however, gives mixing layer depths consistently matching the turbulence measurements, although density differences give more stable results. Measurements of turbulent dissipation rates or overturning length scales often yield consistent estimates of mixing layer depths, but there are cases where overturning lengths give distinctly better results. We conclude that overturning length scales give the most reliable measure of mixing layer depth, although conventional shipborne CTDs are seldom capable of sufficiently resolving the overturns.},

Potentialvorticity is a more appropriate diagnostic field variable than angular momentum for the ocean circulation because of the complicated geometry of basins. Patterns of potential vorticity onsurfaces of constant density help validate ocean circulation models, and give physical insight into how the oceancirculation works. High resolution models suggest that the lateral mixing of potential vorticity by mesoscale eddies along isopycnal surfaces is of the same order as large-scale advection, and that the assumption of inviscid, potential-vorticity-conserving flow in the thermocline is not appropriate for the real ocean. A satisfactory test of this conjecture will require the extensive measurements planned for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment. Models also indicate that the transport of water mass properties by mesoscale eddies is largely a mixing along isopycnal surfaces. The wcak temperaturc gradients along isopycnal surfaces in most areas of the ocean limit the effectiveness of the mesoscale eddies in transporting significant amounts of heat across latitude circles.},

Results indicate that supercritical flow within the marine boundary layer, interacting with blocking coastal orography, is forced to decelerate and an atmospheric bow shock forms. The location and orientation of the COAMPS forecast shock matches well with the leading edge of the wave clouds in satellite imagery, and the modeled jump in boundary layer depth across the shock is in good agreement with the aircraft observations. In the parameter space of Froude number and jump strength that develops within the flow (observed and modeled), the shock manifests itself as an undular bore. On the innermost grid (?x = ? km), long, lineal variations in the wind, temperature, and moisture fields are forecast to develop on the subcritical side of the shock front and the modeled wavelength of these perturbations is close to the observed ?4 km wavelength of the cloud lines. Their cellular structure and the quadrature between the vertical velocity and potential temperature fields strongly suggest that these are trapped internal gravity modes. Further, solutions to the Taylor?Goldstein equation for stationary waves, using a model-computed Scorer parameter profile, provide a comparable estimate of ?3 km for a trapped, resonant wavelength. The subkilometer forecasts presented are the highest-resolution real data forecasts with COAMPS to date. Time-dependent outer boundary conditions are supplied to COAMPS by the Naval Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System. The nonhydrostatic nature of the COAMPS model is essential to forecasting these nonhydrostatic, trapped waves.},

We study small-scale and high-frequency turbulent fluctuations in three-dimensional flows under Fourier-mode reduction.
The Navier-Stokes equations are evolved on a restricted set of modes, obtained as a projection on a fractal or homogeneous Fourier set.
We find a strong sensitivity (reduction) of the high-frequency variability of the Lagrangian velocity fluctuations on the degree of mode decimation, similarly to what is already reported for Eulerian statistics.
This is quantified by a tendency towards a quasi-Gaussian statistics, i.e., to a reduction of intermittency, at all scales and frequencies.
This can be attributed to a strong depletion of vortex filaments and of the vortex stretching mechanism.
Nevertheless, we found that Eulerian and Lagrangian ensembles are still connected by a dimensional bridge-relation which is independent of the degree of Fourier-mode decimation.},

  abstract  = {A high-resolution numerical model is used to study the importance of spatial variability in the wind forcing to the separation of a coastal upwelling jet at a cape. An idealized topography and wind field based on observations from the Cape Blanco (Oregon) region are used. Several simulations are investigated, with both the intensity and the spatial structure of the wind forcing varied to isolate the importance of the observed intensification in the wind stress and wind stress curl magnitudes to the separation process. A simulation using a straight coast confirms that the presence of the cape is crucial for separation. Wind stress intensification by itself, with zero curl, does not aid separation. The wind stress curl intensification south of the cape, on the other hand, is important for controlling details of the process. Because the positive wind stress curl drives upwelling, isotherms in the offshore region tilt upward, creating a pressure gradient that sustains an intensification of the southward velocities via the thermal wind balance. This aids jet separation via continuity and by creating potential vorticity contours that track far offshore of the cape. The timing of the separation is dependent on the intensity of the wind stress curl (stronger curl leads to earlier separation), while how far offshore the jet is deflected depends on the offshore extent of the region of positive curl close to the coast (increasing the extent increases the deflection).},

  abstract  = {In this paper we deal with the interpretation of observed oscillations in the tropical troposphere and stratosphere within the framework of the equatorial wave theory. A difficulty with this problem arises when one compares the short vertical wavelength (or equivalent depth) predicted by the classical theory and the observed large vertical scales associated with the low Doppler-shifted frequencies of the tropospheric oscillations. In this analysis it is shown that the inclusion of simple linear damping, justified by budget studies which revealed the important role of cumulus momentum transport, has a strong influence at low frequencies on the forced equatorial waves and results in two types of dispersive relationships. The first type is characteristic of the regular internal gravity waves which have fast phase speeds and weak vertical attenuation. The second type is dominated by the viscous damping time scale and has slow phase speeds and strong vertical trapping. The theory predicts that the stratosphere oscillations may be identified with the first type and the tropospheric oscillations with the second. In the case of Kelvin waves the results can be used to explain consistently both the observed stratospheric Kelvin waves and the planetary-scale Kelvin-like oscillations in the troposphere including the 40?50 day oscillation and the monsoon and Walker circulations. Possible implications with respect to other waves in the tropics are also discussed.},

  abstract = { Abstract Wind measurements by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scatterometer (NSCAT) and the SeaWinds scatterometer on the NASA QuikSCAT satellite are compared with buoy observations to establish that the accuracies of both scatterometers are essentially the same. The scatterometer measurement errors are best characterized in terms of random component errors, which are about 0.75 and 1.5 m s1 for the along-wind and crosswind components, respectively. The NSCAT and QuikSCAT datasets provide a consistent baseline from which recent changes in the accuracies of 10-m wind analyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are assessed from consideration of three time periods: September 1996?June 1997, August 1999?July 2000, and February 2002?January 2003. These correspond, respectively, to the 9.5-month duration of the NSCAT mission, the first 12 months of the QuikSCAT mission, and the first year after both ECMWF and NCEP began assimilating QuikSCAT observations. There were large improvements in the accuracies of both NWP models between the 1997 and 2000 time periods. Though modest in comparison, there were further improvements in 2002, at least partly attributable to the assimilation of QuikSCAT observations in both models. There is no evidence of bias in the 10-m wind speeds in the NCEP model. The 10-m wind speeds in the ECMWF model, however, are shown to be biased low by about 0.4 m s-1. While it is difficult to eliminate systematic errors this small, a bias of 0.4 m s1 corresponds to a typical wind stress bias of more than 10{\%}. This wind stress bias increases to nearly 20{\%} if atmospheric stability effects are not taken into account. Biases of these magnitudes will result in significant systematic errors in ocean general circulation models that are forced by ECMWF winds. },

The global picture of these common oceanic phenomena, however, is still incomplete in many aspects. This paper presents a feasibility study of using collocated wind speed and significant wave height measurements from simultaneous satellite scatterometer and altimeter sources to observe the spatial and seasonal pattern of dominant swell and wind wave zones in the world's oceans. Two energy-related normalized indices are proposed, on the basis of which global statistics of swell/wind sea probabilities and intensities are obtained. It is found that three well-defined tongue-shaped zones of swell dominance, termed ?swell pools,? are located in the eastern tropical areas of the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Indian Oceans, respectively. Regions of intensive wave growth are observed in the northwest Pacific, the northwest Atlantic, the Southern Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea. Seasonality is distinct for the climate of both swell and wind sea, notably the large-scale northward bending of the swell pools in boreal summer, and the dramatic shift of wave-growing extent from a summer low to an autumn high. The results of this study may serve as a useful reference for a variety of activities, such as ocean wave modeling, satellite algorithm validation, coastal engineering, and ship routing, when information on swell and wind sea conditions is needed.},

Thin layers range in vertical dimension from a few centimeters to three meters, and have been observed to extend horizontally for kilometers. They appear in the water column episodically and can persist for days. We present some of the results of an investigation of four coastal sites along the west coast of the United States to assess frequency of occurrence of thin layers of zooplankton. Our study sites included coastal sites near East Sound, Washington; Cape Perpetua, Oregon; Monterey Bay, California; and Santa Barbara, California. At each site, we collected several, weeks-long time series of hydrography, current velocity, and acoustic backscatter due to mesozooplankton. Our results show that thin layers were common features at all four sites. Across all study sites, a change in the predominant physical regime, usually precipitated by a change in the wind pattern, corresponded with an absence of thin Zooplankton layers. In order to make a first-order prediction about when thin layers have the possibility of occurring in a coastal environment, we found it useful to examine regional wind and circulation patterns and to determine how they affect stratification in each local environment.},

This ensemble shows hemispheric and regional differences in posterior flux estimates that are beyond 1 sigma uncertainties and in some regions are unrealistic. We recognize the importance of these satellite data in further understanding the contemporary carbon cycle but we argue that more resources should be invested in characterizing the errors of the prior fluxes, the systematic errors of the retrievals, and the systematic errors of the transport models, to improve confidence in the resulting posterior fluxes.},

At both mooring locations, the surface mixed layer is generally heated during MJO calm phases. During MJO active phases at both mooring locations, the surface mixed layer is always cooled by the net surface heat flux and also sometimes by the turbulent heat flux at the bottom of the surface mixed layer. The turbulent heat flux at the bottom of the surface mixed layer, however, varies greatly among different MJO active phases and between the two mooring locations. A barrier layer exerts control on the turbulent heat flux at the base of the surface mixed layer; we quantify this barrier layer strength by a {``}barrier layer potential energy,{''} which depends on the thickness of the barrier layer, the thickness of the surface mixed layer, and the density stratification across the isothermal layer. During one observed MJO active phase, a strong turbulent heat flux into the mixed layer was diagnosed, despite the presence of a 10$-$20 m thick barrier layer. This was due to the strong shear across the barrier layer driven by the westerly winds, which provided sufficient available kinetic energy to erode the barrier layer. To better simulate and predict net surface heat fluxes and the MJO, models must estimate the oceanic barrier layer potential energy, background shear, stratification, and surface forcing accurately.},

The motility of the organism is described by an average upward swimming speed U and a diffusivity tensor D.

For deep layers the maximum growth rate determines a preferred pattern size explicitly in terms of U and D. The results are compared with observations of patterns formed by the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis.},

Diurnal warming most typically reaches maximum values of 3C, although very localized events may reach 7?8C. An analysis of multiple years of diurnal warming over the global ice-free oceans indicates that heat fluxes determined by using the predawn sea surface temperature can differ by more than 100{\%} in localized regions over those in which the sea surface temperature is allowed to fluctuate on a diurnal basis. A comparison of flux climatologies produced by these two analyses demonstrates that significant portions of the tropical oceans experience differences on a yearly average of up to 10 W m-2. Regions with the highest climatological differences include the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, as well as the equatorial western and eastern Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the western coasts of Central America and North Africa. Globally the difference is on average 4.45 W m-2. The difference in the evaporation rate globally is on the order of 4{\%} of the total ocean-atmosphere evaporation. Although the instantaneous, year-to-year, and seasonal fluctuations in various locations can be substantial, the global average differs by less than 0.1 W m-2 throughout the entire 10-yr time period. A global heat budget that uses atmospheric datasets containing diurnal variability but a sea surface temperature that has removed this signal may be underestimating the flux to the atmosphere by a fairly constant value.},

In particular, they focus on characteristics such as the TKE and the dissipation rate in the upper layers of the equatorial ocean, especially the phenomenon of deep episodic penetration well below the mixed layer of elevated dissipation rates commonly observed in microstructure measurements in the central tropical Pacific. Model simulations for the Tropic Heat experiments in 1984 and 1987 and Tropical Instability Wave Experiment in the central Pacific as well as the Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) Intensive Operating Period (IOP) observations in the western Pacific warm pool are performed. Modeled dissipation rates are found to be in reasonable agreement with those measured by microstructure profilers during these observations. Sensitivity studies are carried out to investigate the mechanisms underlying the deep penetration process. The authors find that the deep penetration of turbulence arises simply due to the instability and mixing resulting from the background vertical shear of the Equatorial Undercurrent enhanced by the easterly winds. The process is present whether or not there is nocturnal cooling. Deep penetration of turbulence is absent during westerlies, and then the behavior of the equatorial mixed layer is more like that of a high-latitude mixed layer. The modeled dissipation rates in the tropical western Pacific warm pool are in agreement with values observed during the TOGA COARE IOP. Both TKE and dissipation rates are significantly elevated in the mixed layer during westerly wind bursts. However, because of the weak background shear due to an undercurrent that is too weak and too deep in this region, turbulent mixing does not penetrate much below the mixed layer in the warm pool.},

  abstract = { ABSTRACT Experimental evidence suggests that in the turbulent mixing layer the fundamental mechanism of growth is two-dimensional and little affected by the presence of vigorous three-dimensional motion. To quantify this apparent property and study the growth of streamwise vorticity, we write for the velocity field [{\boldmath V}(x, t) = {\boldmath U}(x, z, t) + {\boldmath u}(x, y, z, t),\] where U is two-dimensional and u is three-dimensional. In a first version of the problem U is independent of u, while in the second U is the spanwise average of V. In both cases the equation for u is linearized around U. The equations for U and u are solved simultaneously by a finite-difference calculation starting with a slightly disturbed parallel shear layer.The solutions provide a detailed description of the growth of the three-dimensional motion. They show that its characteristics are dictated by the distribution of spanwise vorticity which results from roll-up and pairing. Pairing inhibits its growth. The solutions also demonstrate that even when the three-dimensional flow attains large amplitudes it has a negligible effect on the interaction of spanwise vortices and thus on the growth of the layer. },

  abstract  = {Barrier layers between the base of a shallow halocline and the top of the thermocline are a common feature of the western Pacific warm pool. In this paper, we investigate barrier layer formation and erosion processes associated with two westerly wind bursts (WWB). WWBs are typically associated with increased rainfall, but increased wind stirring and convective mixing from surface cooling can cause the fresh water to mix down to the top of the thermocline and thereby erode preexisting or newly formed barrier layers. However, not all WWBs lead to barrier layer erosion. In this study, we show that a WWB in November 1989 was associated with the formation of an extremely (100 m) thick barrier layer. During this event, zonal and meridional advection of surface fresh water from the west and north were the dominant processes responsible for the thick barrier layer, while rainfall was a secondary process. Likewise, during the Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment, a relatively thick barrier layer formed near 0, 160E and 0, 165E following the October 1992 WWB. Zonal convergence associated with this WWB caused a zonal salinity gradient to intensify. The surface-intensified wind-driven jet then tilted the zonal salinity gradient into the vertical, thus generating a shallow halocline above the top of the thermocline. In both events, feedbacks appear to have occurred between formation of stratification and formation of vertical shear. Shear formed through a depth-dependent pressure gradient associated with the salinity gradient and through trapping of wind-forced momentum above the developing stratification. The increased sheared flow then led to further surface-intensified fresh water advection and stratification. These examples illustrate how, in the presence of zonal and meridional salinity gradients, the equatorial ocean's response to WWBs can include the formation of thick, long-lived barrier layers.},

  abstract = {Nearly all operational ocean models use air-sea fluxes and the ocean shear and stratification to estimate upper ocean boundary layer mixing rates. This approach implicitly parameterizes surface wave effects in terms of these inputs. Here we test this assumption using parallel experiments in a lake with small waves and in the open ocean with much bigger waves. Under the same wind stress and adjusting for buoyancy flux, we find the mixed layer average turbulent vertical kinetic energy in the open ocean typically twice that in the lake. The increase is consistent with models of Langmuir turbulence, in which the wave Stokes drift, and not wave breaking, is the dominant mechanism by which waves energize turbulence in the mixed layer. Applying these same theories globally, we find enhanced mixing and deeper mixed layers resulting from the inclusion of Langmuir turbulence in the boundary layer parameterization, especially in the Southern Ocean.},

This suggests that the buoyancy flux achieved by swimming animals in the ocean may be negligible in spite of the observed large kinetic energy dissipation rates. The present letter suggests that vertical migration across isopycnals may be necessary in order to generate overturning and subsequent mixing at length scales significantly larger than the individual animals. The animal-fluid interactions are simulated here using a simplified potential flow model of solid spheres migrating vertically in a stably stratified fluid. The interaction of successive solid bodies with each parcel of fluid is shown to lead, under certain conditions, to vertical displacement of the fluid parcels over distances much larger than the individual body size. These regions of displaced fluid are unstably stratified and, hence, amenable to large-scale overturning and efficient mixing.},

  abstract  = {Upwelling jets flow alongshore in approximate geostrophic balance with the onshore pressure gradient induced by coastal upwelling. Observations of such jets have shown that they often move offshore downstream of capes, leaving a pool of upwelled water inshore. Comparisons are made between this behavior and the hydraulic transition of a potential-vorticity-conserving coastal current as it passes a topographic anomaly at which it is exactly critical to long coastal-trapped waves. An analytic 1.5-layer model of coastal hydraulics with constant potential vorticity in each layer predicts flow fields (i.e., jet separation) in critical situations that resemble observations. When scales approximate Cape Blanco on the Oregon coast, separation occurs at a jet transport of around 0.76 ? 106 m3 s?1, similar to observed transports. Time-dependent, semigeostrophic calculations suggest that, during an upwelling season, the jet would evolve from a weak flow, which was subcritical everywhere and symmetric about the cape, to an exactly critical state that made a transition from subcritical to supercritical structure at the head of the cape. The predicted flow field at critical transition consists of a narrow upwelling jet upstream of the cape that moves offshore and broadens at the cape. This critical state would be accompanied by a downstream jump back to subcritical conditions. Further upwelling-favorable winds would lead to transient waves that propagated upstream and downstream, modifying the upstream and downstream conditions and restoring criticality. Thus, the head of the cape exerts hydraulic control on the flow and prevents the jet transport from increasing above its critical level. Inherent in the hydraulic approach is the assumption that alongshore scales are large. For realistic alongshore scales, solutions modified by coastline curvature suggest that the convexity of the head of a cape slightly inhibits the transition to a strongly upwelled downstream state by increasing the required critical transport. In the presence of topographic features with finite alongshore scale, the hydraulic approach can be used to construct a flow field, although this flow field has an inherent error arising from the implicit assumptions regarding scales. Estimation of this error for topography representing Cape Blanco suggests that in places the cape is rather abrupt for hydraulic theory to be valid.},

  abstract  = {DYNAMO and TOGA-COARE observations and reanalysis-based surface flux products are used to test theories of atmosphere-ocean interaction that explain the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Negative intraseasonal outgoing longwave radiation, indicating deep convective clouds, is in phase with increased surface wind stress, decreased solar heating, and increased surface turbulent heat flux?mostly evaporation?from the ocean to the atmosphere. Net heat flux cools the upper ocean in the convective phase. Sea surface temperature (SST) warms during the suppressed phase, reaching a maximum before the onset of MJO convection. The timing of convection, surface flux, and SST is consistent from the central Indian Ocean (70E) to the western Pacific Ocean (160E).Mean surface evaporation observed in TOGA COARE and DYNAMO (110 W m?2) accounts for about half of the moisture supply for the mean precipitation (210 W m?2 for DYNAMO). Precipitation maxima are an order of magnitude larger than evaporation anomalies, requiring moisture convergence in the mean, and on intraseasonal and daily time scales. Column-integrated moisture increases 2 cm before the convectively active phase over the research vessel Revelle in DYNAMO, in accord with MJO moisture recharge theory. Local surface evaporation does not significantly recharge the column water budget before convection. As suggested in moisture mode theories, evaporation increases the moist static energy of the column during convection. Rather than simply discharging moisture from the column, the strongest daily precipitation anomalies in the convectively active phase accompany increasing column moisture.},

A total of 6720 uniform grid intervals were used, with sub-grid scale effects simulated with eddy coefficients proportional to the local velocity deformation. The agreement of calculated statistics against those measured by Laufer ranges from good to marginal. The eddy shapes are examined, and only the u-component, longitudinal eddies are found to be elongated in the downstream direction. However, the lateral v eddies have distinct downstream tilts. The turbulence energy balance is examined, including the separate effects of vertical diffusion of pressure and local kinetic energy.It is concluded that the numerical approach to the problem of turbulence at large Reynolds numbers is already profitable, with increased accuracy to be expected with modest increase of numerical resolution. },

Resulting modifications of the upper ocean in current and hydrology are quantified using data from an equatorial mooring at 165E and from three cruises within 30 days of one another along 165E. During westerly wind bursts (WWB) stronger than 4 m s$-$1, the upper 50 m becomes isothermal to within 0.1C and sea surface temperature (SST) drops by 0.3-0.4C between 5S and 2.5N. Conversely, SST starts warming and the upper 50 m restratifies in 4-5 days after the end of WWB. In contrast to previous observations, salinity between 0 and 50 m appears almost unaffected by WWB; it freshens by 0.4 practical salinity unit in March within an area of 1-2 degrees of  latitude around the equator but not necessarily in direct response to WWB. As for zonal circulation, surface equatorial flow accelerates eastward 2-3 days after the beginning of westerlies. Then, after less than 2 weeks, eastward and westward jets both develop from 2N to 2S in the upper and lower halves of the temperature mixed layer, respectively. Changes in zonal mass transport in this layer were as much as 30 Sv between 2.5S and 2.5N from one cruise to the next.},

  abstract = { ABSTRACT The interaction between shear and buoyancy effects for Benard convection in plane Couette flow is studied by performing direct numerical simulations. At moderate Rayleigh number (10000-50000), shear tends to organize the flow into quasi-two-dimensional rolls parallel to the mean flow and can enhance heat transfer, while at higher Rayleigh number (>150000), shear tends to disrupt the formation of convective plumes and can reduce heat transfer. A significant temporal oscillation in the local Nusselt number was consistently observed at high Rayleigh numbers, a factor that may contribute to the scatter seen in experimental data. This effect, plus the time-varying reversal of the mean temperature gradient in the middle of the channel, is consistent with a flow model in which the dynamics of large-scale, quasi-two-dimensional, counter-rotating vortical cells are alternately driven by buoyancy and inertial effects. An analysis of the energy balance in the flow shows that the conservative pressure diffusion term, which has been frequently neglected in turbulence models, plays a very important dynamical role in the flow evolution and should be more carefully modelled. Most of the turbulent energy production due to mean shear is generated in the boundary layers, while the buoyant production occurs mainly in the relatively uniform convective core. The simulations and the laboratory experiments of Deardorff & Willis (1967) are in very reasonable qualitative agreement, suggesting that the basic dynamics of the flow are being accurately simulated. },

  abstract = { Abstract The mixed layer heat balance in the Southern Ocean is examined by combining remotely sensed measurements and in situ observations from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2006, coinciding with the period during which Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (EOS) (AMSR-E) sea surface temperature measurements are available. Temperature/salinity profiles from Argo floats are used to derive the mixed layer depth. All terms in the heat budget are estimated directly from available data. The domain-averaged terms of oceanic heat advection, entrainment, diffusion, and air?sea flux are largely consistent with the evolution of the mixed layer temperature. The mixed layer temperature undergoes a strong seasonal cycle, which is largely attributed to the air?sea heat fluxes. Entrainment plays a secondary role. Oceanic advection also experiences a seasonal cycle, although it is relatively weak. Most of the seasonal variations in the advection term come from the Ekman advection, in contrast with western boundary current regions where geostrophic advection controls the total advection. Substantial imbalances exist in the regional heat budgets, especially near the northern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The biggest contributor to the surface heat budget error is thought to be the air?sea heat fluxes, because only limited Southern Hemisphere data are available for the reanalysis products, and hence these fluxes have large uncertainties. In particular, the lack of in situ measurements during winter is of fundamental concern. Sensitivity tests suggest that a proper representation of the mixed layer depth is important to close the budget. Salinity influences the stratification in the Southern Ocean; temperature alone provides an imperfect estimate of mixed layer depth and, because of this, also an imperfect estimate of the temperature of water entrained into the mixed layer from below. },

  abstract = {This study focuses on the improved estimation of mesoscale surface ocean circulation obtained by merging TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) and ERS-1 and -2 altimeter measurements between October 1992 and May 1998. Once carefully intercalibrated and homogenized, these data are merged through an advanced global objective analysis method that allows us to correct for residual long wavelength errors and uses realistic correlation scales of ocean dynamics. The high-resolution (0.25x0.25) merged T/P+ERS-1 and -2 sea level anomaly maps provide more homogeneous and reduced mapping errors than either individual data set and more realistic sea level and geostrophic velocity statistics than T/P data alone. Furthermore, the merged T/P+ERS-1 and -2 maps yield eddy kinetic energy (EKE) levels 30% higher than maps of T/P alone. They also permit realistic global estimates of east and north components of EKE and their seasonal variations, to study EKE sources better. A comparison of velocity statistics with World Ocean Circulation Experiment surface drifters in the North Atlantic shows very good agreement. Comparison with contemporary current meter data in various oceanic regimes also produces comparable levels of energy and similar ratios of northward and eastward energy, showing that the maps are suitable to studying anisotropy. The T/P + ERS zonal and meridional components of the mapped currents usually present comparable rms variability, even though the variability in the Atlantic is more isotropic than that in the Pacific, which exhibits strong zonal changes. The EKE map presents a very detailed description, presumably never before achieved at a global scale. Pronounced seasonal changes of the EKE are found in many regions, notably the northeastern Pacific, the northeastern and northwestern Atlantic, the tropical oceans, and the zonally extended bands centered near 20S in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans and at 20N in the northwestern Pacific.},

  abstract  = {This study investigates the exchange of momentum between the atmosphere and ocean using data collected from four oceanic field experiments. Direct covariance estimates of momentum fluxes were collected in all four experiments and wind profiles were collected during three of them. The objective of the investigation is to improve parameterizations of the surface roughness and drag coefficient used to estimate the surface stress from bulk formulas. Specifically, the Coupled Ocean?Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) 3.0 bulk flux algorithm is refined to create COARE 3.5. Oversea measurements of dimensionless shear are used to investigate the stability function under stable and convective conditions. The behavior of surface roughness is then investigated over a wider range of wind speeds (up to 25 m s?1) and wave conditions than have been available from previous oversea field studies. The wind speed dependence of the Charnock coefficient $\alpha$ in the COARE algorithm is modified to , where m = 0.017 m?1 s and b = ?0.005. When combined with a parameterization for smooth flow, this formulation gives better agreement with the stress estimates from all of the field programs at all winds speeds with significant improvement for wind speeds over 13 m s?1. Wave age? and wave slope?dependent parameterizations of the surface roughness are also investigated, but the COARE 3.5 wind speed?dependent formulation matches the observations well without any wave information. The available data provide a simple reason for why wind speed?, wave age?, and wave slope?dependent formulations give similar results?the inverse wave age varies nearly linearly with wind speed in long-fetch conditions for wind speeds up to 25 m s?1.},

  abstract = {Altimetric data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission will be used for studies of global ocean circulation and marine geophysics. However, it is first necessary to remove the ocean tides, which are aliased in the raw data. The tides are constrained by two distinct types of information: the hydrodynamic equations which the tidal fields of elevations and velocities must satisfy, and direct observational data from tide gauges and satellite altimetry. Here we develop and apply a generalized inverse method, which allows us to combine rationally all of this information into global tidal fields best fitting both the data and the dynamics, in a least squares sense. The resulting inverse solution is a sum of the direct solution to the astronomically forced Laplace tidal equations and a linear combination of the representers for the data functionals. The representer functions (one for each datum) are determined by the dynamical equations, and by our prior estimates of the statistics of errors in these equations. Our major task is a direct numerical calculation of these representers. This task is computationally intensive, but well suited to massively parallel processing. By calculating the representers we reduce the full (infinite dimensional) problem to a relatively low-dimensional problem at the outset, allowing full control over the conditioning and hence the stability of the inverse solution. With the representers calculated we can easily update our model as additional TOPEX/POSEIDON data become available. As an initial illustration we invert harmonic constants from a set of 80 open-ocean tide gauges. We then present a practical scheme for direct inversion of TOPEX/POSEIDON crossover data. We apply this method to 38 cycles of geophysical data records (GDR) data, computing preliminary global estimates of the four principal tidal constituents, M2, S2, K1, and O1. The inverse solution yields tidal fields which are simultaneously smoother, and in better agreement with altimetric and ground truth data, than previously proposed tidal models. Relative to the?default tidal corrections provided with the TOPEX/POSEIDON GDR, the inverse solution reduces crossover difference variances significantly (20-30%), even though only a small number of free parameters (1000) are actually fit to the crossover data.},

Convection is treated as a means of rapidly redistributing in the vertical heat acquired from the sea surface, rather than as a heat source in and of itself. The model produces a spectrum of equatorially trapped oscillating instabilities, among which is an eastward-propagating wavenumber 1 disturbance with an intrinsic phase speed in the range of 4?20 m s?1, depending on the mean zonal wind, the surface exchange coefficients, the air-sea equivalent potential temperature difference, and the difference of absolute temperature across the depth of the lower troposphere. The three-dimensional structure of this mode is in excellent agreement with observations and recent numerical experiments concerning the 30?60 day oscillation. The phase speed and growth rate of the disturbances depend only on conditions at the equator, while their meridional structure varies with meridional gradients of mean zonal wind, sea surface temperature, and the depth of the moist convective layer. Momentum fluxes by the waves may serve to maintain mean easterlies at the equator. The model also predicts nongeostrophic oscillations with generally shorter periods of around one week.},

  abstract = {Two volume control methods are used to analyze the upper ocean heat and salt balances in response to a westerly wind burst event in the western equatorial Pacific during the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment. One method uses a fixed-thickness surface layer, and the other uses an isopycnal depth as the lower boundary. Horizontal advection terms in the budget calculations are estimated using the R/V Wecoma repeat hydrographic survey data within a 133 km 133 km region. In both methods, the upper ocean heat budget is balanced within 10 W m2 of the surface air-sea flux observations during a 19-day time period, which covers the December 1992 westerly wind burst and a low-wind recovery period in early January 1993. The standard error in the estimation of heat advection is 11 W m2. The salt budget yields a rain rate estimate of 15.4 mmd1 with an error bar of 4 mmd1. This estimate is within 20% of the optical rain gauge measurements. The advection terms are important in both the heat and salt balances. Meridional advection dominates over zonal and vertical advection, acting to decrease temperature and increase salinity in the surface layer. From the isopycnal boundary method, the diapycnal turbulent flux transports a mean heat flux of 17 W m2 into the thermocline. Diapycnal advection is almost equally important, so that the total heat flux into the thermocline is estimated to be more than 30 W m2 during the study time period. Both terms are also important in the salt budget.},

Solar radiation heating is introduced as a time-dependent source term in the heat conduction equation, and surface cooling processes are represented by a constant heat flux out of the top of the ocean. Wind mixing is represented by eddy coefficients of viscosity and conductivity. The calculations show that convection is inhibited by the solar radiation during the day, but usually soon after sunset the water column became unstable, and convection took place near the sea surface. As night progressed, the convection penetrated more deeply until nearly isothermal conditions in the upper layers prevailed. The convection ceased soon after sunrise. The horizontal spacing of convection cells increased with increasing eddy coefficients. When the eddy coefficients became very large, convection did not take place. The turbidity of the water had only a slight effect on the convection process.},

  abstract = {Microscale variability of phytoplankton has been detected in vertical profiles in the ocean for decades, yet its mechanism of formation remains unclear. Here a mechanism is presented which can generate thin (10s of centimeters) layers of phytoplankton through the interaction of near-inertial wave shear with horizontal (along-isopycnal) patchiness of phytoplankton. Horizontal biomass patches along isopycnals are advected over each other by the vertical shear of near-inertial waves, generating layers in vertical profiles. The thickness of the phytoplankton layers can be much less than the vertical wavelength of the internal wave, due to tilting and stretching of horizontal patches of phytoplankton. The thickness of the layers is directly related to the vertical shear and the along-isopycnal scale of the phytoplankton patches: shorter horizontal scales generate thinner layers for a given shear. The amplitude of the biomass difference between layers is directly proportional to both the along-isopycnal and vertical biomass gradients. The model predicts the thickness, time of occurrence and duration of layers during the internal wave's cycle. This mechanism is likely a ubiquitous feature of the world's ocean, and would be particularly important in regions of strong horizontal gradients of properties.},

  abstract = {Horizontal advection, vertical mixing, and mixed-layer entrainment all affect iron concentrations and biological productivity in the Ona Basin, near the Shackleton Transverse Ridge (STR) in southern Drake Passage. Trace metal sampling in the region indicates that dissolved iron concentrations are significantly higher on the continental shelf near the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands than they are in the deep waters away from the shelf. Comparisons between satellite-derived sea surface height (SSH) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) levels in the Ona Basin show &gt; 95 % correlation between Chl-a concentrations and horizontal advection of these iron-rich shelf waters during the months of November and December for the years 1997-2010. However, no significant correlations are found for January?April, while high Chl-a concentrations in the Ona Basin persist through March. Enhanced vertical (diapycnal) mixing and mixed-layer entrainment are considered as alternative mechanisms for delivering iron into the Ona Basin mixed layer and sustaining the high Chl-a concentrations. Estimates of iron flux based on in situ measurements of dissolved iron concentrations suggest that diapycnal mixing alone can supply iron to the base of the mixed layer at a rate of 64 nmol m2 day1 during the summer. In addition, the summer mixed layer in the Ona Basin deepens from January to April, allowing for iron-rich water to be steadily entrained from below. Estimates based on monthly mixed-layer climatologies produce average daily entrainment rates ranging from 5 to 25 nmol m2 day1. While neither diapycnal mixing nor entrainment alone is always sufficient to meet the estimated iron demand for the Ona Basin bloom, numerical simulation suggests that the combined effect of the two processes can consistently supply sufficient iron to sustain the bloom. },

It is shown that the wave forcing in Langmuir circulation models is much stronger than that due to a surface buoyancy loss, and studies of the erosion by the cells of a pre-existing stratification are described. Mixed layer models will also need to allow for horizontal inhomogeneity. It is shown, for example, that the horizontal buoyancy gradient that may be left behind after a storm produces restratification that can be significant. The nonlinearity of the equation of state is another real-world factor; it gives rise to an annual average surface buoyancy that is misleading as it is compensated by interior cabbeling. Current work linking the mixed layer to water mass formation is also introduced.},

  abstract = { Abstract Ocean surface turbulence at high sea states is evaluated using heat as a naturally occurring passive tracer. A freely drifting instrument with a mechanically driven temperature profiler, fixed depth thermistors, and conductivity cells was used to monitor breaking wave activity and fine-scale temperature structure within the upper 2 m of the water column. The combination of temperature profiles and independent heat flux measurements demonstrate the presence of wave-enhanced turbulence and the effects of subsurface advection due to Langmuir circulation. The turbulence length scale, extracted from the temperature profile fine structure, suggests a surface value significantly smaller than previously reported. A Prandtl-type mixing length model matched with a surface energy flux due to wave breaking and the observed turbulent length scale is consistent with the authors observations. Both advection and enhanced diffusion are reconciled in a two-dimensional model of the upper-ocean boundary layer, providing a framework for studying Langmuir circulation and upper-ocean turbulence in terms of the measured temperature structure. },

The transition to turbulence has been well characterized in laboratory settings and numerical simulations at moderate Reynolds number--it involves rolling up, i.e., overturning of the density structure within the cores of the instabilities. In contrast, measurements in an energetic estuarine shear zone reveal that the mixing induced by shear instability at high Reynolds number does not primarily occur by overturning in the cores; rather it results from secondary shear instabilities within the zones of intensified shear separating the cores. This regime is not likely to be observed in the relatively low Reynolds number flows of the laboratory or in direct numerical simulations, but it is likely a common occurrence in the ocean and atmosphere.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested recently that episodes of westerly wind near the international date line in the western Pacific tend to fall into one of four types. Three of the types have enough equatorial zonal wind variation to be able to induce an eastern Pacific response by forcing equatorial waves. In this note we examine the central and eastern Pacific waveguide response to idealized representations of these three types of westerly wind episodes, using a combination of linear theory and results from an ocean general circulation model. The idealized westerly wind types are the C type (maximum anomalies centered on the equator), the N type (maximum anomalies just north of the equator), and the S type (maximum anomalies just south of the equator). The composite C-type event excites equatorially trapped Kelvin pulses that alter sea surface temperature in the central and eastern Pacific. Warm anomalies caused by the C-type episode have approximately equal contributions from a zonal advection of heat by the Kelvin pulses and a meridional advection of heat by an altered instability wave field. Because the center of forcing of the S-type event is displaced off of the equator, the Kelvin pulses excited by the S-type episode have smaller amplitude than those of the C-type episode, even though the maximum wind anomaly is the same in the two cases. The S-type anomaly also excites weak Rossby-gravity waves that can propagate into the eastern Pacific. Because the Rossby-gravity waves are dispersive, their amplitude diminishes as the waves propagate into the eastern Pacific. The N-type episode, as observed in winds from the western tropical Pacific, is much weaker and of shorter duration than the C and S types, and therefore excites only a very weak eastern Pacific response. Although all types of westerly wind excite a local western Pacific response, only the C- and S-type events excite a significant eastern Pacific response.},

  abstract = { Abstract Four years of ocean vector wind data are used to evaluate statistics of wind stress over the ocean. Raw swath wind stresses derived from the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) are compared with five different global gridded wind products, including products based on scatterometer observations, meteorological analysis winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and reanalysis winds from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Buoy winds from a limited number of sites in the Pacific Ocean are also considered. Probability density functions (PDFs) computed for latitudinal bands show that mean wind stresses for the six global products are largely in agreement, while variances differ substantially, by a factor of 2 or more, with swath wind stresses indicating highest variances for meridional winds and for zonal winds outside the Tropics. Higher moments of the PDFs also differ. Kurtoses are large for all wind products, implying that PDFs are not Gaussian. None of the available gridded products fully captures the range of extreme wind events seen in the raw swath data. Frequency spectra for the five gridded products agree with frequency spectra from swath data at low frequencies, but spectral slopes differ at higher frequencies, particularly for frequencies greater than 100 cycles per year (cpy), which are poorly resolved by a single scatterometer. In the frequency range between 10 and 90 cpy that is resolved by the scatterometer, spectra derived from swath data are flatter than spectra from gridded products and are judged to be flatter than 2/3 at all latitudes. },

  abstract  = {During August 2006 aggregations of nekton, most likely small fish, intersected microstructure survey lines in Monterey Bay, California, providing an opportunity to examine biologically generated mixing. Some aggregations filled the water column, 80 m deep, and extended 100-200 m along the survey track. Others were half that size, and some were much smaller. Acoustic energy backscattered from the aggregations was measured with a calibrated echosounder and yielded volume backscattering strength Sv values of -80 to 060 dB re 1 m-1. Turbulent dissipation rates were {$10^6$}-{$10^5$} W kg-1 in the more intense aggregations. Within these, was much more uniform than turbulence measured outside the aggregations and varied with S. Three similar aggregations contributed half of the average in 142 profiles taken along a 5-km-long survey line during a 12.5-h tidal cycle. Turbulence within aggregations differed markedly from that outside in the following three ways: (i) Thorpe scales, that is, root-mean-square overturning lengths, were much smaller than Ozmidov scales, LOZ $\equiv$ (/N3)1/2, the upper limit for overturns limited by stratification. (ii) Spectra of small-scale shear matched the universal shape only in the viscous high-wavenumber rolloff. At lower wavenumbers, the shear spectra had slopes closer to k1 than to the k1/3 Kolmogorov slope with a corresponding velocity spectra peak near 8 cpm. (iii) Temperature gradient spectra matched portions of the universal Batchelor spectrum that could be resolved, but their magnitudes were smaller than those in turbulence produced by flow instabilities. Average mixing efficiency {$\Gamma$} was 0.0022 within aggregations, compared with 0.23 outside. This 100-fold decrease in efficiency compensates for a 100-fold increase in to produce no net change in diapycnal diffusivity K. Because the composition and behavior of the aggregations were not confirmed that is, whether the nekton had regular spacing and swimming patterns characterizing schools it is not possible to know whether one or many turbulent states were sampled within aggregations. If these observations are representative, mixing in aggregations may be more interesting than it is important, but the data are too few for definitive conclusions.},

Petrographic study indicates that the pebbles are lithologically similar to a number of rock types exposed along the Columbia River and its tributaries in Oregon and eastern Washington. The catastrophic late Pleistocene glacial floods which scoured this area of the Pacific Northwest transported coarse material derived from these outcrops down the river to the ocean. These catastrophic events are believed to have generated high-velocity and high-density turbidity currents which transported the coarse sediment for many hundreds of kilometers along the sea floor.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Modeling Eddies in the Southern Ocean (MESO) project uses numerical sensitivity studies to examine the role played by Southern Ocean winds and eddies in determining the density structure of the global ocean and the magnitude and structure of the global overturning circulation. A hemispheric isopycnal-coordinate ocean model (which avoids numerical diapycnal diffusion) with realistic geometry is run with idealized forcing at a range of resolutions from coarse (2) to eddy-permitting (1/6). A comparison of coarse resolutions with fine resolutions indicates that explicit eddies affect both the structure of the overturning and the response of the overturning to wind stress changes. While the presence of resolved eddies does not greatly affect the prevailing qualitative picture of the ocean circulation, it alters the overturning cells involving the Southern Ocean transformation of dense deep waters and light waters of subtropical origin into intermediate waters. With resolved eddies, the surface-to-intermediate water cell extends farther southward by hundreds of kilometers and the deep-to-intermediate cell draws on comparatively lighter deep waters. The overturning response to changes in the winds is also sensitive to the presence of eddies. In noneddying simulations, changing the Ekman transport produces comparable changes in the overturning, much of it involving transformation of deep waters and resembling the mean circulation. In the eddy-permitting simulations, a significant fraction of the Ekman transport changes are compensated by eddy-induced transport drawing from lighter waters than does the mean overturning. This significant difference calls into question the ability of coarse-resolution ocean models to accurately capture the impact of changes in the Southern Ocean on the global ocean circulation.},

  abstract  = {The interactions between boundary layer turbulence, including Langmuir turbulence, and submesoscale processes in the oceanic mixed layer are described using large-eddy simulations of the spindown of a temperature front in the presence of submesoscale eddies, winds, and waves. The simulations solve the surface-wave-averaged Boussinesq equations with Stokes drift wave forcing at a resolution that is sufficiently fine to capture small-scale Langmuir turbulence. A simulation without Stokes drift forcing is also performed for comparison. Spatial and spectral properties of temperature, velocity, and vorticity fields are described, and these fields are scale decomposed in order to examine multiscale fluxes of momentum and buoyancy. Buoyancy flux results indicate that Langmuir turbulence counters the restratifying effects of submesoscale eddies, leading to small-scale vertical transport and mixing that is 4 times greater than in the simulations without Stokes drift forcing. The observed fluxes are also shown to be in good agreement with results from an asymptotic analysis of the surface-wave-averaged, or Craik?Leibovich, equations. Regions of potential instability in the flow are identified using Richardson and Rossby numbers, and it is found that mixed gravitational/symmetric instabilities are nearly twice as prevalent when Langmuir turbulence is present, in contrast to simulations without Stokes drift forcing, which are dominated by symmetric instabilities. Mixed layer depth calculations based on potential vorticity and temperature show that the mixed layer is up to 2 times deeper in the presence of Langmuir turbulence. Differences between measures of the mixed layer depth based on potential vorticity and temperature are smaller in the simulations with Stokes drift forcing, indicating a reduced incidence of symmetric instabilities in the presence of Langmuir turbulence.},

  abstract  = {The scaling of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and its vertical component (VKE) in the upper ocean boundary layer, forced by realistic wind stress and surface waves including the effects of Langmuir circulations, is investigated using large-eddy simulations (LESs). The interaction of waves and turbulence is modeled by the Craik?Leibovich vortex force. Horizontally uniform surface stress {\oe}{\~{N}}0 and Stokes drift profiles uS(z) are specified from the 10-m wind speed U10 and the surface wave age CP/U10, where CP is the spectral peak phase speed, using an empirical surface wave spectra and an associated wave age?dependent neutral drag coefficient CD. Wave-breaking effects are not otherwise included. Mixed layer depths HML vary from 30 to 120 m, with 0.6 {\quotesinglbase}{\^{a}}{\S} CP/U10 {\quotesinglbase}{\^{a}}{\S} 1.2 and 8 m s?1 < U10 < 70 m s?1, thereby addressing most possible oceanic conditions where TKE production is dominated by wind and wave forcing. The mixed layer?averaged bulk VKE ?w2?/u*2 is equally sensitive to the nondimensional Stokes e-folding depth D*S/HML and to the turbulent Langmuir number Lat = u*/US, where u* = |{\oe}{\~{N}}0|/?w in water density ?w and US = |uS|z=0. Use of a D*S scale-equivalent monochromatic wave does not accurately reproduce the results using a full-surface wave spectrum with the same e-folding depth. The bulk VKE for both monochromatic and broadband spectra is accurately predicted using a surface layer (SL) Langmuir number LaSL = u*/ uS SL, where uS SL is the average Stokes drift in a surface layer 0 > z >  0.2HML relative to that near the bottom of the mixed layer. In the wave-dominated limit LaSL ? 0, turbulent vertical velocity scales as wrms ? u*La?2/3SL. The mean profile (z) of VKE is characterized by a subsurface peak, the depth of which increases with D*S/HML to a maximum near 0.22HML as its relative magnitude /?w2? decreases. Modestly accurate scalings for these variations are presented. The magnitude of the crosswind velocity convergence scales differently from VKE. These results predict that for pure wind seas and HML ? 50 m, ?w2?/u*2 varies from less than 1 for young waves at U10 = 10 m s?1 to about 2 for mature seas at winds greater than U10 = 30 m s?1. Preliminary comparisons with Lagrangian float data account for invariance in ?w2?/u*2 measurements as resulting from an inverse relationship between U10 and CP/U10 in observed regimes.},

These processes are associated with different phases of a large-scale (here tidal) internal gravity wave: (i) highly nonlinear turbulent bores during the upslope propagating phase, and (ii) Kelvin-Helmholtz billows, at some distance above the slope, during the downslope phase. Whilst the former may be associated in part with convective turbulent overturning following Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities RTi?, the latter is mainly related to shear-induced Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. In this paper, details are particularly presented of rare (convective) \{RTi\} penetrating stable density stratification under high-frequency internal waves. Such apparent RTi can be explained using both stability parameterization of entrainment across a density interface, and, more relevant here, internal wave acceleration overcoming the reduced gravity. },

Several types of frequency of occurrence and duration statistics are presented; events in which the maximum westerly anomalies exceed 7 m s1 are not common, but are prominent in the records. There is strong seasonal and geographical variation in frequency of occurrence. Four types of westerly episodes are found; we call them types N, C, S, or FS, according to whether the maximum westerly wind is found north of, centered on, south of, or far south of the equator near the international date line. Sixteen, 45, 47, and 47 events of type N, C, S, and FS are identified, respectively. The strongest westerly winds are associated with type C and S events; maximum daily average values can exceed 20 m s?1. Only type C and S events are found to have substantial equatorial zonal wind anomalies. Several examples of type C and S events are presented. Composite events of each type have been computed, and their characteristics are described. In order to explore relationships between equatorial westerly events and cyclones, all of the named tropical cyclones within a region encompassing the near-date line islands have been identified; various statistics are presented, but no absolute relationships have been identified. The similarity between the composite type C and S anomaly patterns and patterns of the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation monthly mean zonal wind anomaly previously documented in the literature is striking; evidently, the westerly events often dominate in the monthly average anomaly.},

Instability can only occur when the Richardson number is less than 1\&sol;4 somewhere in the flow. We consider cases where the Richardson number is everywhere non- negative. The eigenvalue problem is expressed in terms of four parameters, J a \&lsquo;typical\&rsquo; Richardson number, \&alpha; the (real) wavenumber and c the complex phase speed of the disturbance. Two computer programs are developed to integrate the stability equation and to solve for eigenvalues: the first finds c given \&alpha; and J, the second finds \&alpha; and J when c \&equiv; 0 (i.e. it computes the stationary neutral curve for the flow). This is sometimes, but not always, the stability boundary in the \&alpha;, J plane. The second program works only for cases where the velocity and density profiles are antisymmetric about the velocity inflexion point. By means of these two programs, several configurations of velocity and density have been investigated, both of the free-shear-layer type and the jet type. Calculations of temporal growth rates for particular profiles have been made.},

  abstract  = {An improved method for estimating the directional spectrum of linear surface gravity waves from in Situ observations is presented. The technique, a refinement and extension of the inverse method of Long and Hasselmann, is applicable to multicomponent wave measurements at fixed locations in constant or slowly varying depth water. On a frequency band by frequency band basis, an estimate of the directional distribution of wave energy S(?) is obtained by minimizing a roughness measure of the form ?d?[d2S(?)/d?2]2 subject to the constraints: (i) S(?) is nonnegative with unit integral, (ii) S(?) fits the data within a chosen statistical confidence level, and (iii) S(?) is zero on any directional sectors where energy levels are always relatively low because of the influence of geographic surroundings. The solution to this inverse problem is derived through a variational formulation with Lagrange multipliers. A series of simulations using the new estimator show the fundamental limitations of sparse array data and the importance of using all available data-independent information [i.e., constraints (i) and (iii)] for achieving optimal estimates. The advantages of smoothness optimization are illustrated in a comparison of the present and Long and Hasselmann methods. The present method yields smooth estimates where Long and Hasselmann obtained rough estimates with multiple spurious peaks. A smooth solution to the inverse problem that has only truly resolved features is both easier to interpret and more readily evaluated numerically than wildly spurious solutions. The examples also demonstrate the subjectivity of intercomparing estimation techniques. A few illustrative examples are presented of S(?) estimates obtained from a two-dimensional array (aperture 120 m ? 96 m) of 14 pressure transducer in 6 m water depth. Estimates using the full array and no geographic constraints are smooth and exhibit the expected refractive columnation of shoreward propagating energy towards normal incidence. Additionally, reflection from the mildly sloping beach 310 m shoreward of the center of this array is very weak at wind wave and swell frequencies. Estimates of S(?) made using only the sensors on a longshore line, and a constraint of no reflected energy, are very similar to S(?) obtained with the full array and no constraint.},

  abstract = { When a suspension of bacterial cells of the species Bacillus subtilis is placed in a chamber with its upper surface open to the atmosphere complex bioconvection patterns are observed. These arise because the cells: (1) are denser than water; and (2) usually swim upwards, so that the density of an initially uniform suspension becomes greater at the top than the bottom. When the vertical density gradient becomes large enough, an overturning instability occurs which ultimately evolves into the observed patterns. The reason that the cells swim upwards is that they are aerotactic, i.e. they swim up gradients of oxygen, and they consume oxygen. These properties are incorporated in conservation equations for the cell (N) and oxygen (C) concentrations, and these are solved in the pre-instability phase of development when N and C depend only on the vertical coordinate and time. Numerical results are obtained for both shallow- and deep-layer chambers, which are intrinsically different and require different mathematical and numerical treatments. It is found that, for both shallow and deep chambers, a thin boundary layer, densely packed with cells, forms near the surface. Beneath this layer the suspension becomes severely depleted of cells. Furthermore, in the deep chamber cases, a discontinuity in the cell concentration arises between this cell-depleted region and a cell-rich region further below, where no significant oxygen concentration gradients develop before the oxygen is fully consumed. The results obtained from the model are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.},

  abstract = {The dominant processes governing ocean mixing during an active phase of the Madden-Julian oscillation are identified. Air-sea fluxes and upper-ocean currents and hydrography, measured aboard the R/V Revelle during boreal fall 2011 in the Indian Ocean at 0, 80.5E, are integrated by means of a large-eddy simulation (LES) to infer mixing mechanisms and quantify the resulting vertical property fluxes. In the simulation, wind accelerates the mixed layer, and shear mixes the momentum downward, causing the mixed layer base to descend. Turbulent kinetic energy gains due to shear production and Langmuir circulations are opposed by stirring gravity and frictional losses. The strongest stirring of buoyancy follows precipitation events and penetrates to the base of the mixed layer. The focus here is on the initial 24 h of an unusually strong wind burst that began on 24 November 2011. The model shows that Langmuir turbulence influences only the uppermost few meters of the ocean. Below the wave-energized region, shear instability responds to the integrated momentum flux into the mixed layer, lagging the initial onset of the storm. Shear below the mixed layer persists after the storm has weakened and decelerates the surface jet slowly (compared with the acceleration at the peak of the storm). Slow loss of momentum from the mixed layer extends the effect of the surface wind burst by energizing the fluid at the base of the mixed layer, thereby prolonging heat uptake due to the storm. Ocean turbulence and air-sea fluxes contribute to the cooling of the mixed layer approximately in the ratio 1:3, consistent with observations.},

Two trapping mechanisms are observed in the developing Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) billow train. Within the K-H billows, a particle can remain preferentially in downwelling regions, cancelling its upward swimming motion. In the braids that separate the billows, intense shear defeats the gyrotactic stabilization mechanism and causes cells to tumble. Particle and continuum models are compared statistically to reveal both consistencies and weaknesses in each. A scaling based on Reynolds number and swimming speed is used to predict the maximum concentration generated by an instability event. Although K-H billows are short lived in comparison with planktonic thin layers observed in the coastal oceans, the resulting trapping causes rapid aggregation. We conclude that trapping in a growing K-H instability could contribute to the development of the observed cell concentrations.},

This formulation is facilitated by first determining Hamilton's principle for the \{CL\} equations. The \{CL\} Hamilton's principle is similar to that for a fluid plasma, driven by a rapidly varying external electromagnetic field via ``J'' minimal coupling, after averaging the plasma action over the fast phase of the (single frequency) driving field. This similarity leads to a precise analogy between the \{CL\} vortex force and the Lorentz force on an electrically charged fluid due to an exernally imposed electromagnetic field. We determine the effect of this force on the inflection point criterion and the Richardson number criterion for stability of planar \{CL\} flows. The Noether symmetries of Hamilton's principle for the \{CL\} equations (under fluid particle relabeling) lead to conservation laws for Eulerian mean potential vorticity and helicity, and generate the steady Eulerian mean flows as canonical transformations. The generalized Lagrangian mean theory is discussed from the same viewpoint.},

  abstract = {Mixing efficiency between different water masses is typically assumed to be constant in diapycnal mixing parameterizations used in ocean models. As of now, most coarse resolution ocean circulation models employ a constant mixing efficiency value of 0.2 for the shear driven mixing, internal waves and bottom boundary layer parameterizations. This study investigates the energetics and mixing efficiency of the lock-exchange flow at different Reynolds numbers. The lock-exchange experiment resolves Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices and is an idealized test case for oceanic gravity currents. At first, the required spatial resolution for the direct numerical simulations (DNS) is determined in simulations at a constant Reynolds number of 3500. The evolution of background potential energy and tracer variance are used to assess model results. We found that the model spatial resolution should resolve at least the Kolmogorov scale but not necessarily the Batchelor scale if convergences of background potential energy, tracer variance and dissipation are considered. Simulations at Reynolds number of 125, 500, 1000, 2500, 3500, 5000, 6000, 10000 show that the mixing efficiency in the lock-exchange flow is smaller than 0.2 , and it saturates around 0.12 when Reynolds numbers exceed the value of 2500.},

  volume    = {588},
  pages     = {437--462},
  abstract  = { The diffusive behaviour of swimming micro-organisms should be clarified in order to obtain a better continuum model for cell suspensions. In this paper, a swimming micro-organism is modelled as a squirming sphere with prescribed tangential surface velocity, in which the centre of mass of the sphere may be displaced from the geometric centre (bottom-heaviness). Effects of inertia and Brownian motion are neglected, because real micro-organisms swim at very low Reynolds numbers but are too large for Brownian effects to be important. The three-dimensional movement of 64 or 27 identical squirmers in a fluid otherwise at rest, contained in a cube with periodic boundary conditions, is dynamically computed, for random initial positions and orientations. The computation utilizes a database of pairwise interactions that has been constructed by the boundary element method. In the case of (non-bottom-heavy) squirmers, both the translational and the orientational spreading of squirmers is correctly described as a diffusive process over a sufficiently long time scale, even though all the movements of the squirmers were deterministically calculated. Scaling of the results on the assumption that the squirmer trajectories are unbiased random walks is shown to capture some but not all of the main features of the results. In the case of (bottom-heavy) squirmers, the diffusive behaviour in squirmers' orientations can be described by a biased random walk model, but only when the effect of hydrodynamic interaction dominates that of the bottom-heaviness. The spreading of bottom-heavy squirmers in the horizontal directions show diffusive behaviour, and that in the vertical direction also does when the average upward velocity is subtracted. The rotational diffusivity in this case, at a volume fraction c=0.1, is shown to be at least as large as that previously measured in very dilute populations of swimming algal cells (Chlamydomonas nivalis). },

The magnitude of the seasonal cycle of sea surface temperature (SST) south of the Polar Front is found to be twice that north of the front, but the seasonal cycles of the turbulent heat fluxes show no differences on either side of the Polar Front. Frequency spectra of the turbulent heat fluxes and related variables are red, with no identifiable spectral peaks. SST and air temperature are coherent over a range of frequencies corresponding to periods between ~10 h and 2 days, with SST leading air temperature. The spatial decorrelation length scales of the sensible and latent heat fluxes calculated from two-day transects are 65  6 km and 80  6 km, respectively. The scale of the sensible heat flux is consistent with the decorrelation scale for air-sea temperature differences (70  6 km) rather than either SST (153 km) or air temperature (138 4 km) alone. These scales are dominated by the Polar Front. When the Polar Front region is excluded, the decorrelation scales are 10-20 km, consistent with the first baroclinic Rossby radius.These eddy scales are often unrepresented in the available gridded heat flux products. The Drake Passage ship measurements are compared with four recently available gridded turbulent heat flux products: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts high-resolution operational product in support of the Year of Coordinated Observing Modeling and Forcasting Tropical Convection (ECMWF-YOTC), ECMWF interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim), the Drake Passage reanalysis downscaling (DPRD10) regional product, and the objectively analyzed air-sea fluxes (OAFlux). The decorrelation length scales of the air-sea temperature difference, wind speed, and turbulent heat fluxes from these four products are significantly larger than those determined from shipboard measurements.},

  abstract = { Abstract Results from an analysis of the Southampton Oceanography Centre (SOC) global air-sea heat flux climatology, which has been calculated using in situ weather reports from voluntary observing ships covering the period 1980-93, are presented. Systematic errors in the fluxes arising from differences in observing procedure have been quantified and corrected; the magnitude of these errors is up to 15 W m2 with strong seasonal and regional variations. Despite these corrections, closure of the ocean heat budget is not obtained as the global mean net heat flux is an oceanic gain of 30 W m2. The validity of closing the heat budget by global scaling of the flux components is assessed by comparison of the SOC flux fields with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute research buoy measurements. The level of agreement between the two is found to vary from one site to another. Thus, closure of the ocean heat budget requires regional adjustments to the flux components in order to avoid significant biases in the adjusted fields. Close agreement is found for several buoys deployed in the Subduction Array off the coast of northwest Africa. However, at other buoy deployment sites in the western equatorial Pacific warm pool and south of Bermuda in the North Atlantic, the flux adjustment improves the estimate of the net heat exchange. Further evidence for regional biases is obtained from a comparison of box mean surface heat fluxes derived from hydrographic section data with the corresponding SOC values in the Atlantic and North Pacific. The climatological heat loss is found to be an underestimate in those boxes containing the strongest surface flux expression of the major western boundary currents. },

The turbulent kinetic energy injected near the surface by breaking waves, and the kinetic energy input from Langmuir circulations that may exist in the presence of surface gravity waves, are both parameterized and included in the turbulence model. As expected, the wave breaking elevates both the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate in the upper few meters, well above the classical values expected from similarity theory for shear layers adjacent to a boundary. While there is a significant impact on mixed layer properties near the surface, wave breaking-induced turbulence decays rapidly with distance from the surface and hence the overall effects on the mixed layer are small. On the other hand, the energy input to turbulence from Langmuir cells elevates the turbulent kinetic energy and mixing throughout the mixed layer, and is therefore more effective in deepening the mixed layer. While the changes in sea surface temperature (SST) brought about by the inclusion of Langmuir cells are rather small on diurnal time scales, they can be appreciable over seasonal time scales. Nevertheless, these SST changes are well within the uncertainties in the modeled SST resulting from an imperfect knowledge of the air-sea fluxes used to drive the mixed layer models.},

  abstract = {Internal tides in the Middle Atlantic Bight region are found to be noticeably influenced by the presence of the shelfbreak front and the Gulf Stream, using a combination of observations, equations, and data-driven model simulations. To identify the dominant interactions of these waves with subtidal flows, vertical-mode momentum and energy partial differential equations are derived for small-amplitude waves in a horizontally and vertically sheared mean flow and in a horizontally and vertically variable density field. First, the energy balances are examined in idealized simulations with mode-1 internal tides propagating across and along the Gulf Stream. Next, the fully nonlinear dynamics of regional tide-mean-flow interactions are simulated with a primitive-equation model, which incorporates realistic summer-mesoscale features and atmospheric forcing. The shelfbreak front, which has horizontally variable stratification, decreases topographic internal-tide generation by about 10% and alters the wavelengths and arrival times of locally generated mode-1 internal tides on the shelf and in the abyss. The (sub)mesoscale variability at the front and on the shelf, as well as the summer stratification itself, also alter internal-tide propagation. The Gulf Stream produces anomalous regions of 
O(20 mW m?2) mode-1 internal-tide energy-flux divergence, which are explained by tide-mean-flow terms in the mode-1 energy balance. Advection explains most tide-mean-flow interaction, suggesting that geometric wave theory explains mode-1 reflection and refraction at the Gulf Stream. Geometric theory predicts that offshore-propagating mode-1 internal tides that strike the Gulf Stream at oblique angles (more than thirty degrees from normal) are reflected back to the coastal ocean, preventing their radiation into the central North Atlantic.},

Collocated airborne measurements of methane and nitrous oxide acquired during the COBRA-NA campaign in May-June 2003, analyzed using a receptor-oriented Lagrangian particle dispersion model, provide robust validation of independent bottom-up emission estimates from the EDGAR and GEIA inventories.
We find that the EDGAR {CH$_4$} emission rates are slightly low by a factor of 1.08{$\pm$}0.15 (2{$\sigma$}), while both EDGAR and GEIA {N$_2$O} emissions are significantly too low, by factors of 2.62{$\pm$}0.50 and 3.05{$\pm$}0.61, respectively, for this region.
Potential footprint bias may expand the statistically retrieved uncertainties. Seasonality of agricultural {N$_2$O} emissions may help explain the discrepancy.
Total anthropogenic U.S. and Canadian emissions would be 49 Tg {CH$_4$} and 4.3 Tg {N$_2$O} annually, if these inventory scaling factors applied to all of North America.},

The model versions considered resolve heights between the ground and 80 km, and the horizontal grid spacing of the highest-resolution version is about 35 km. Tropospheric kinetic energy spectra show the familiar 3 power-law dependence on horizontal wavenumber for wavelengths between about 5000 and 500 km and have a slope of 5/3 at smaller wavelengths. Qualitatively similar behavior is seen in the stratosphere and mesosphere, but the wavelength marking the transition to the shallow regime increases with height, taking a value of 2000 km in the stratosphere and 4000 km in the mesosphere. The global spectral kinetic energy budget for various height ranges is computed as a function of total horizontal wavenumber. Contributions to the kinetic energy tendency from nonlinear advective processes, from conversion of available potential energy, from mechanical fluxes through the horizontal boundaries of the region, and from parameterized subgrid-scale dissipation are all examined. In the troposphere, advective contributions are negative at large scales and positive over the rest of the spectrum. This is consistent with a predominantly downscale nonlinear cascade of kinetic energy into the mesoscale. The global kinetic energy budget in the middle atmosphere differs significantly from that in the troposphere, with the positive contributions at most scales coming predominantly from vertical energy fluxes. The kinetic energy spectra calculated from two model versions with different horizontal resolution are compared. Differences between the spectra over the resolved range of the lower-resolution version are smallest in the troposphere and increase with height, owing mainly to large differences in the divergent components. The result suggests that the parameterization of dynamical subgrid-scale processes in middle-atmosphere general circulation models, as well as in high-resolution tropospheric general circulation models, may need to be critically reevaluated.

A coupled wind?wave model is developed based on the assumption that in the equilibrium range of surface wave spectra the wind stress is dominated by the form drag of breaking waves. By conserving both momentum and energy in the air and also imposing the wave energy balance, coupled equations are derived governing the turbulent stress, wind speed, and the breaking-wave distribution (total breaking crest length per unit surface area as a function of wavenumber). It is assumed that smaller-scale breaking waves are sheltered from wind forcing if they are in airflow separation regions of longer breaking waves (spatial sheltering effect). Without this spatial sheltering, exact analytic solutions are obtained; with spatial sheltering asymptotic solutions for small- and large-scale breakers are derived. In both cases, the breaking-wave distribution approaches a constant value for large wavenumbers (small-scale breakers). For low wavenumbers, the breaking-wave distribution strongly depends on wind forcing. If the equilibrium range model is extended to the spectral peak, the model yields the normalized roughness length (Charnock coefficient) of growing seas, which increases with wave age and is roughly consistent with earlier laboratory observations.

We present a direct comparison between observations and large eddy simulations, based on the wave-averaged Navier-Stokes equation, of an LC growth event. The evolution of cross-wind velocity variance and spatial scales, as well as mixed layer deepening are only consistent with simulations if LC effects are included in the model. Our results offer a validation of the large eddy simulation approach to understanding LC dynamics, and demonstrate the importance of LC in ocean surface layer mixing.},

  abstract  = {There is increasing evidence that the Madden?Julian oscillation (MJO) modifies the mid- to high-latitude circulation and, in particular, appears to have a relationship to the leading mode of extratropical variability, the Arctic Oscillation (AO). In this study, new insights into the observed similarities between the MJO and the AO are explored. It is shown that the eastward progression of the convectively active phase of the MJO is associated with a corresponding shift in the tendency and sign of the AO index. Moreover, the AO and the MJO share several analogous features not only in the global circulation, but also in surface temperature fields. Also, the AO is linked to a pattern of eastward-propagating MJO-like variability in the tropics that is partially reproduced in free runs of the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS) model. Finally, it is shown that the structure of the AO, as defined by the leading mode in the 1000-hPa geopotential height field, is significantly altered based on the phase of the MJO.},

  abstract = {If model parameterizations of unresolved physics, such as the variety of upper ocean mixing processes, are to hold over the large range of time and space scales of importance to climate, they must be strongly physically based. Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed. Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffusion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic boundary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribution to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and nonlocal transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with similarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocalK profile parameterization? (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmospheric counterparts. Its most important feature is shown to be the capability of the boundary layer to penetrate well into a stable thermocline in both convective and wind-driven situations. The diffusivities of the aforementioned three interior mixing processes are modeled as constants, functions of a gradient Richardson number (a measure of the relative importance of stratification to destabilizing shear), and functions of the double-diffusion density ratio, R. Oceanic simulations of convective penetration, wind deepening, and diurnal cycling are used to determine appropriate values for various model parameters as weak functions of vertical resolution. Annual cycle simulations at ocean weather station Papa for 1961 and 1969-1974 are used to test the complete suite of parameterizations. Model and observed temperatures at all depths are shown to agree very well into September, after which systematic advective cooling in the ocean produces expected differences. It is argued that this cooling and a steady salt advection into the model are needed to balance the net annual surface heating and freshwater input. With these advections, good multiyear simulations of temperature and salinity can be achieved. These results and KPP simulations of the diurnal cycle at the Long-Term Upper Ocean Study (LOTUS) site are compared with the results of other models. It is demonstrated that the KPP model exchanges properties between the mixed layer and thermocline in a manner consistent with observations, and at least as well or better than alternatives.},

Drag coefficients from 196 Reynolds flux measurements agree well with those reported in Smith (1980) based on independent observations at the same site. Based on 192 runs, a comparison of the dissipation and Reynolds flux results shows excellent agreement on average, for wind speeds from 4 to 20 m s?1. The much more extensive dissipation data set (1086 h from the tower and 505 h from the weathership PAPA, CCGS Quadra) was used to investigate the dependence of the drag coefficient on wind speed, fetch and stability. The drag coefficient reduced to 10 m height and neutral conditions (CDN), is independent of stability and fetch (for fetch/height ?800) but increases with wind speed above 10 m s?1. Some time series of the momentum flux and drag coefficient are shown to demonstrate additional sources of variation in the drag coefficient. CDN is observed to be smaller, on average. during rising winds than during failing winds or after a change in wind direction. Based on our results and many deep water results of others, we obtainwhere U10 is the wind speed at a height of 10 m. A method for calculating the stress from this CDN and observations of wind speed and surface minus air temperature at heights other than 10 m is also given.},

All fluxes are computed over the 23 years from 1984 to 2006, but radiation prior to 1984 and precipitation before 1979 are given only as climatological mean annual cycles. The input data are based on NCEP reanalysis only for the near surface vector wind, temperature, specific humidity and density, and on a variety of satellite based radiation, sea surface temperature, sea-ice concentration and precipitation products. Some of these data are adjusted to agree in the mean with a variety of more reliable satellite and in situ measurements, that themselves are either too short a duration, or too regional in coverage. The major adjustments are a general increase in wind speed, decrease in humidity and reduction in tropical solar radiation. The climatological global mean air--sea heat and freshwater fluxes (1984--2006) then become 2W/m2 and 0.1mg/m2 per second, respectively, down from 30 W/m2 and 3.4?mg/m2 per second for the unaltered data. However, decadal means vary from 7.3 W/m2 (1977--1986) to 0.3 W/m2 (1997--2006). The spatial distributions of climatological fluxes display all the expected features. A comparison of zonally averaged wind stress components across ocean sub-basins reveals large differences between available products due both to winds and to the stress calculation. Regional comparisons of the heat and freshwater fluxes reveal an alarming range among alternatives; typically 40?W/m2 and 10?mg/m2 per second, respectively. The implied ocean heat transports are within the uncertainty of estimates from ocean observations in both the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific basins. They show about 2.4?PW of tropical heating, of which 80{\%} is transported to the north, mostly in the Atlantic. There is similar good agreement in freshwater transport at many latitudes in both basins, but neither in the South Atlantic, nor at 35{\textdegree}N.},

In principle, measurements of high-frequency acoustic scattering from oceanic microstructure and zooplankton across a broad range of frequencies can reduce the ambiguities typically associated with the interpretation of acoustic scattering at a single frequency or a limited number of discrete narrowband frequencies. With this motivation, a high-frequency broadband scattering system has been developed for investigating zooplankton and microstructure, involving custom modifications of a commercially available system, with almost complete acoustic coverage spanning the frequency range 150-600 kHz. This frequency range spans the Rayleigh-to-geometric scattering transition for some zooplankton, as well as the diffusive roll-off in the spectrum for scattering from turbulent temperature microstructure. The system has been used to measure scattering from zooplankton and microstructure in regions of non-linear internal waves. The broadband capabilities of the system provide a continuous frequency response of the scattering over a wide frequency band, and improved range resolution and signal-to-noise ratios through pulse-compression signal-processing techniques. System specifications and calibration procedures are outlined and the system performance is assessed. The results point to the utility of high-frequency broadband scattering techniques in the detection, classification, and under certain circumstances, quantification of zooplankton and microstructure.},

Here the process of internal-tide generation and dissipation by tidal flow over an isolated Gaussian topography is examined, using two-dimensional numerical simulations employing the MITgcm. Four different topographies are considered, for five different amplitudes of barotropic forcing, thereby allowing a variety of combinations of key nondimensional parameters. While much recent attention has focused on the role of relative topographic steepness and height in modifying the rate of conversion of energy from barotropic to baroclinic modes, here attention is focused on parameters dependent on the flow amplitude. For narrow topography, large amplitude forcing gives rise to baroclinic responses at higher harmonics of the forcing frequency. Tall narrow topographies are found to be the most conducive to mixing. Dissipation rates in these calculations are most efficient for the narrowest topography. },

  abstract = {The substantial wave energy resource of the US Pacific Northwest (i.e. off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and N. California) is assessed and characterized. Archived spectral records from ten wave measurement buoys operated and maintained by the National Data Buoy Center and the Coastal Data Information Program form the basis of this investigation. Because an ocean wave energy converter must reliably convert the energetic resource and survive operational risks, a comprehensive characterization of the expected range of sea states is essential. Six quantities were calculated to characterize each hourly sea state: omnidirectional wave power, significant wave height, energy period, spectral width, direction of the maximum directionally resolved wave power and directionality coefficient. The temporal variability of these characteristic quantities is depicted at different scales and is seen to be considerable. The mean wave power during the winter months was found to be up to 7 times that of the summer mean. Winter energy flux also tends to have a longer energy period, a narrower spectral width, and a reduced directional spread, when compared to summer months. Locations closer to shore, where the mean water depth is less than 50{~}m, tended to exhibit lower omnidirectional wave power, but were more uniform directionally. Cumulative distributions of both occurrence and contribution to total energy are presented, over each of the six quantities characterizing the resource. It is clear that the sea states occurring most often are not necessarily those that contribute most to the total incident wave energy. The sea states with the greatest contribution to energy have significant wave heights between 2 and 5{~}m and energy periods between 8 and 12{~}s. Sea states with the greatest significant wave heights (e.g.&gt;7{~}m) contribute little to the annual energy, but are critically important when considering reliability and survivability of ocean wave energy converters.},

  abstract = {A large eddy simulation (LES) model is used to examine how buoyancy-driven thermal convection, wind-driven shear turbulence and wind/wave-driven Langmuir circulation compete to generate turbulence in the ocean surface mixed layer. The turbulent Langmuir number Lat, a ratio of friction velocity to surface Stokes drift velocity, and the Hoenikker number Ho, a ratio of buoyancy forcing to wave forcing, are two controlling dimensionless parameters. We explore low-order turbulence statistics in the Lat and Ho parameter space for a wide range of atmospheric forcing conditions and construct a regime diagram to differentiate buoyancy-, shear- and wave-driven turbulence. All three types of turbulent flows are anisotropic but show different orderings of turbulence intensities: vertical &gt; (downwind, crosswind) in convective turbulence; downwind&gt;crosswind&gt;vertical in shear turbulence; crosswind $\approx$ vertical&gt; downwind in Langmuir turbulence. These orderings of turbulence intensities can be explained by examining the turbulence energy production in three directions. Buoyancy production in the vertical direction dominates turbulence generation in convective turbulence, whereas shear production in the downwind direction dominates turbulence generation in shear-driven turbulence. In Langmuir turbulence, however, Stokes production due to surface waves generates turbulence energy in both crosswind and vertical directions.},

By using two ships, data were taken continuously from November 4 to December 12, 1991, near the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory mooring at ON, 140W. The ships occupied the station sequentially with a 3.5-day overlap for intercalibration. Variability in currents was observed on tidal periods, and periods of 4 days (presumably equatorially trapped internal gravity waves), 8 days (cause unknown), 20 days (tropical instability waves), and longer (Kelvin waves). Variation in water structure occurred most prominently on the timescale of Kelvin waves. The diurnal cycle typical of that location was observed: nocturnal deepening of the surface mixed layer was accompanied by a?deep cycle,? bursts of turbulence penetrating into the stratified region below the nighttime mixed layer. During the observational period, one Kelvin wave trough and one crest passed through the site. Changes accompanying the phase change in the Kelvin wave included a reversal of the near-surface current, a deepening of the thermocline, and a change of water mass. Changes in small-scale activity included a tenfold decrease of the thermal dissipation rate and a fourfold decrease of the rate of heat transport downward from the mixed layer. The nighttime mixed layer deepened from 30 to 60 m. The thickness of the stratified region in which nocturnal turbulence bursts occurred, the deep cycle region, thinned from 40 to 20 m because it was confined between the bottom of the nighttime mixed layer and the low-shear region near the core of the undercurrent. The decrease in downward heat flux observed at this passage of the downwelling Kelvin wave front could explain the rapid sea surface temperature (SST) increase seen at El Nino onsets. The magnitude of the change in vertical flux is similar to the magnitude of the change in horizontal advection. This process would produce a warmer SST much more quickly than could the advection of warm waters eastward.},

  abstract = {Inertial oscillations are a ubiquitous feature of the surface ocean. Here we combine new observations with a numerical model to investigate the role of inertial oscillations in driving deepening of the surface mixed layer in a seasonally stratified sea. Observations of temperature and current structure, from a mooring in the Western Irish Sea, reveal episodes of strong currents (>0.3 m s?1) lasting several days, resulting in enhanced shear across the thermocline. While the episodes of strong currents are coincident with windy periods, the variance in the shear is not directly related to the wind stress. The shear varies on a subinertial time scale with the formation of shear maxima lasting several hours occurring at the local inertial period of 14.85 h. These shear maxima coincide with the orientation of the surface current being at an angle of approximately 90 to the right of the wind direction. Observations of the water column structure during windy periods reveal deepening of the surface mixed layer in a series of steps which coincide with a period of enhanced shear. During the periods of enhanced shear gradient, Richardson number estimates indicate Ri?1/4 at the base of the surface mixed layer, implying the deepening as a result of shear instability. A one-dimensional vertical exchange model successfully reproduces the magnitude and phase of the shear spikes as well as the step-like deepening. The observations and model results therefore identify the role of wind shear alignment as a key entrainment mechanism driving surface mixed layer deepening in a shallow, seasonally stratified sea.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Kelvin-Helmholtz problem deals with the stability of fluids where both shear and stable stratification are restricted to a layer. In observed shear instability in the atmosphere, stable stratification rarely disappears outside the shear zone. In order to get some idea of the implications of this fact, I have investigated the stability properties of a particularly simple configuration: a Helmholtz velocity profile in a continuously stratified, infinite Boussinesq fluid. For a basic discontinuity 2U and Brunt-V. frequency N, I find that perturbations with horizontal wavenumbers k, such that k2>N2/(2U2), are unstable and decay away from the shear zone. In addition, the shear zone is capable of supplying energy to neutral internal gravity waves, for which k2<N2/U2, which propagate away from the shear zone. A particular wavenumber, k2 = N2/(2U2), is shown to be most efficient at carrying energy away from the shear zone. However, additional calculations suggest that for the configuration considered, instabilities ought to be more effective than waves in smoothing the original shear. Comparison with observations suggests, on the other hand, that the waves dominate observed disturbances. The reasons for this are discussed. It is suggested that the waves are enhanced by reflections from the earth's surface which were ignored in the calculations.},

  abstract  = {It was shown by Stokes that in a water wave the particles of fluid possess, apart from their orbital motion, a steady second-order drift velocity (usually called the mass-transport velocity). Recent experiments, however, have indicated that the mass-transport velocity can be very different from that predicted by Stokes on the assumption of a perfect, non-viscous fluid. In this paper a general theory of mass transport is developed, which takes account of the viscosity, and leads to results in agreement with observation. Part I deals especially with the interior of the fluid. It is shown that the nature of the motion in the interior depends upon the ratio of the wave amplitude a to the thickness of the boundary layer: when is small the diffusion of vorticity takes place by viscous 'conduction'; when a2/ 2 is large, by convection with the mass-transport velocity. Appropriate field equations for the stream function of the mass transport are derived. The boundary layers, however, require separate consideration. In part II special attention is given to the boundary layers, and a general theory is developed for two types of oscillating boundary: when the velocities are prescribed at the boundary, and when the stresses are prescribed. Whenever the motion is simple-harmonic the equations of motion can be integrated exactly. A general method is described for determining the mass transport throughout the fluid in the presence of an oscillating body, or with an oscillating stress at the boundary. In part III, the general method of solution described in parts I and II is applied to the cases of a progressive and a standing wave in water of uniform depth. The solutions are markedly different from the perfect-fluid solutions with irrotational motion. The chief characteristic of the progressive-wave solution is a strong forward velocity near the bottom. The predicted maximum velocity near the bottom agrees well with that observed by Bagnold.},

  abstract = {The mixed layer of the western equatorial Pacific and its thermodynamics are poorly known because of a general lack of data. Conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles from the recent Western Equatorial Pacific Ocean Circulation Study (WEPOCS) cruises have been analyzed for various measures of the upper layer and mixed layer thickness, using criteria which depend on vertical gradients of temperature, salinity, and density. From 434 profiles, the average mixed layer depth in the western equatorial Pacific during the two WEPOCS cruises was 29 m, which is about a factor of 3 shallower than had previously been thought. The mean depth of the top of the thermocline was found to be 64 m, so there is a nearly isothermal layer that is deeper than the mixed layer. This discrepancy is attributable to salinity stratification. It is hypothesized that the waters in this {\textquotedblleft}barrier{\textquotedblright} layer between the bottom of the mixed layer and the top of the thermocline are formed to the east of the WEPOCS region, and subducted below the shallow and lighter mixed layer waters found in the west. Under light wind conditions, there was a tendency for warm and thin layers to form at the sea surface as a result of diurnal heating; however, there did not appear to be any nighttime maximum to the mixed layer depth associated with convective overturn due to cooling. This contrast with the central Pacific may be caused by the influence of salinity on the thermodynamics of the mixed layer. A strong westerly wind burst was observed during WEPOCS II, and apparently the mixed layer nearly doubled in depth while cooling by more than 1$\deg$C. Evidence of downwelling near the equator, and upwelling off the equator, was seen in the distribution of temperature, salinity, and density in the meridional section along 143$\deg$E, which was occupied immediately following the wind event. This event was apparently strong enough to erode through the salinity-stratified layer and into the thermocline, resulting in the observed cooling. The results of this study suggest that except during strong wind events, entrainment cooling may not be an important component of the heat budget of the western Pacific warm pool. This has potentially important implications for the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.},

The simulations are based on the reduced dynamical equations of rotating stratified turbulence. In the reduced dynamical equations only wave modes are retained, and vortices and horizontally uniform vertical shears are excluded. Despite the simplifications, our simulations reproduce some key features of oceanic internal-wave spectra: accumulation of energy at near-inertial waves and realistic frequency and horizontal wavenumber dependencies. Furthermore, we provide evidence that formation of the energy spectra in the inertial subrange is dominated by scale-separated interactions with the near-inertial waves. These findings support observationally based intuition that spectral energy density of internal waves is the result of predominantly wave-wave interactions.},

  abstract  = {Recent research has shown that Lighthill{\quotesinglbase} Ford spontaneous gravity wave generation theory, when applied to numerical model data, can help predict areas of clear-air turbulence. It is hypothesized that this is the case because spontaneously generated atmospheric gravity waves may initiate turbulence by locally modifying the stability and wind shear. As an improvement on the original research, this paper describes the creation of an operational algorithm (ULTURB) with three modifications to the original method: (1) extending the altitude range for which the method is effective downward to the top of the boundary layer, (2) adding turbulent kinetic energy production from the environment to the locally produced turbulent kinetic energy production, and, (3) transforming turbulent kinetic energy dissipation to eddy dissipation rate, the turbulence metric becoming the worldwide standard. In a comparison of ULTURB with the original method and with the Graphical Turbulence Guidance second version (GTG2) automated procedure for forecasting mid- and upper-level aircraft turbulence ULTURB performed better for all turbulence intensities. Since ULTURB, unlike GTG2, is founded on a self-consistent dynamical theory, it may offer forecasters better insight into the causes of the clear-air turbulence and may ultimately enhance its predictability.

  abstract  = {Rainfall over the ocean is one of the most important climatic parameters for both oceanic and atmospheric science. Traditional accumulation-type rain gauges are difficult to operate at sea, and so an alternate technique using underwater sound has been developed. The technique of passive monitoring of the ocean rainfall using ambient sound depends on the accuracy of sound pressure level (SPL) detection. Consequently, absolute calibration of the hydrophone is desirable, but is difficult to achieve because typically the geometry of the laboratory calibration process does not fit the measurement geometry over the ocean. However, if one assumes that the sound signal that is generated by wind is universal then the wind signal can be used to provide an absolute calibration. Over 90 buoy months of ambient sound spectra have been collected on the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) project array since 1998. By applying the Vagle et al. wind speed algorithm, the instrument noises and sensitivity bias for the absolute calibration of each acoustic rain gauge (ARG) are obtained. An acoustic discrimination process is developed to retrieve the pure geophysical signals. A new single-frequency rainfall-rate algorithm is proposed after comparing the ARG data with R.M. Young self-siphoning rain gauge data, collocated on the same moorings. The acoustic discrimination process and the rainfall algorithm are further tested at two other locations and are compared with R.M. Young rain gauges and the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM) product 3B42. The acoustic rainfall accumulations show the comparable results in both long (year) and short (hours) time scales.},

In addition, time series of station pressure from two tropical stations for the 1890's are examined and indicate that the oscillation is a stationary feature. The cross-spectral analysis suggests that the oscillation is of global scale but restricted to the tropics: it possesses features of an eastward-moving wave whose characteristics change with time. A mean wave disturbance, constructed with data from the IGY, provides additional descriptive material on the spatial and temporal behavior of the oscillation. The manifestation in station pressure consists of anomalies which appear between 10N and 10S in the Indian Ocean region and propagate eastward to the Eastern Pacific. Zonal winds participate in the oscillation and, in general, are out-of-phase between the upper and lower troposphere. Mixing ratios and temperatures are also investigated. The sum total of evidence indicates that the oscillation is the result of an eastward movement of large-scale circulation cells oriented in the equatorial (zonal) plane.},

  abstract  = {Nearly ten years of daily rawinsonde data for Canton Island (3S, 172W) have been subjected to spectrum and cross-spectrum analysis. In the course of this analysis a very pronounced maximum was noted in the co-spectrum of the 850- and 150-mb zonal wind components in the frequency range 0.0245?0.0190 day?1 (41?53 days period). Application of a posteriori sampling theory resulted in a significance level of ?6% (0.1% prior confidence level). This type of significance test is appropriate because no prior evidence or reason existed for expecting such a spectral feature. Subsequent analysis revealed the following structure of the oscillation. Peaks in the variance spectra of the zonal wind are strong in the low troposphere, are weak or non-existent in the 700?400 mb layer, and are strong again in the upper troposphere. No evidence of this feature could be found above 80 mb, or in any of the spectra of the meridional component. The spectrum of station pressure possesses a peak in this frequency range and the oscillation is in phase with the low tropospheric zonal wind oscillation, and out of phase with that in the upper troposphere. The tropospheric temperatures exhibit a similar peak and are highly coherent with the station pressure oscillation; positive station pressure anomalies are associated with negative temperature anomalies throughout the troposphere. Thus, the lower-middle troposphere appears to be a nodal surface with u and P oscillating in phase but 180$\deg$ out of phase above and below this surface. Evidence for this phenomenon was found in shorter records at Kwajalein (9N, 168E) but not at Singapore (1N, 104E) or Balboa, Canal Zone (9N, 79w). We speculate that the oscillation is a large circulation cell oriented in zonal planes and centered in the mid-Pacific.},

  abstract = {Previous literature has suggested that multiple peaks in sea level anomalies (SLA) detected by two-dimensional Fourier Transform (2D-FT) analysis are spectral components of multiple propagating signals, which may correspond to different baroclinic Rossby wave modes. We test this hypothesis in the South Pacific Ocean by applying a 2D-FT analysis to the long Rossby wave signal determined from filtered TOPEX/Poseidon and European Remote Sensing-1/2 satellite altimeter derived SLA. The first four baroclinic mode dispersion curves for the classical linear wave theory and the Killworth and Blundell extended theory are used to determine the spectral signature and energy contributions of each mode. South of 17{\textdegree}S, the first two extended theory modes explain up to 60{\%} more of the variance in the observed power spectral energy than their classical linear theory counterparts. We find that Rossby wave modes 2--3 contribute to the total Rossby wave energy in the SLA data. The second mode contributes significantly over most of the basin. The third mode is also evident in some localized regions of the South Pacific but may be ignored at the large scale. Examination of a selection of case study sites suggests that bathymetric effects may dominate at longer wavelengths or permit higher order mode solutions, but mean flow tends to be the more influential factor in the extended theory. We discuss the regional variations in frequency and wave number characteristics of the extended theory modes across the South Pacific basin.},

Various flux sampling problems are evaluated to eliminate unreliable fluxes. Large drag coefficients are observed with weak large-scale flow. However, the value of the computed drag coefficient at weak wind speeds is sensitive to flux sampling problems and the method of calculation of the drag coefficient, which might be a general characteristic of weak winds. The drag coefficient is significantly larger for short fetch conditions, particularly at strong wind speeds.},

  abstract  = {A multiscale algorithm is proposed for simulations of the spatially-extended dynamics of Langmuir circulation, a wind- and surface-wave-driven convective flow that dominates vertical transport and mixing on the scale of the O ( 100 ) -m deep ocean surface boundary layer. The algorithm is motivated by multiple scale asymptotic analysis of the master partial differential (Navier-Stokes-like) equations and comprises coupled equation sets for the fine- and coarse-scale dynamics. A primary virtue of the resulting multiscale formulation is that dynamical teleconnections between the fine and coarse scales are explicitly identified and computed, enabling fewer fine-scale domains than coarse-scale grid points to be used. Quantitative comparisons between the multiscale simulations and direct numerical simulations of the master partial differential equations are made. Good agreement is demonstrated in the appropriate parameter regime at a cost that is orders of magnitude less than that required for brute-force simulations using the single-scale algorithm. Several novel multiscale physical interactions are identified, highlighting the utility of the algorithm and the potential importance of spatiotemporal modulation of the convective flow on the mean dynamics.},

  abstract = {Several 5 to 10 m s-1 westerly wind bursts of 10-15 days' duration occurred in the western equatorial Pacific during November 1989 to January 1990. The response to these wind bursts was characterized by a 400- to 600-km-wide eastward jet in the upper 100-150 m along the equator between 135E and the date line. Flow in this jet accelerated to speeds of over 100 cm s-1 within 1 week after the onset of westerly winds in November 1989 in association with supertyphoon Irma. In addition, a 20 to 40 cm s-1 westward counterflow developed between 2N and 2S below the surface jet separating it from the eastward flow of the Equatorial Undercurrent in the thermocline. Changes in surface layer zonal volume transports in the western Pacific due to westerly wind bursts were 25-56 Sv based on comparison of three shipboard velocity transects in November and December 1989. Although fluctuations in current speeds in the thermocline were generally smaller and less directly related to local wind forcing than those in the surface layer, the Equatorial Undercurrent decelerated to less than 20 cm s-1 (i.e., less than half its speed before the onset of westerlies) by early December 1989. Westerly winds also produced a strong surface convergence in both the meridional and zonal directions west of the date line. In late November 1989, this convergence was associated with downwelling of 2-3 m d-1 along the equator, and a 20- to 30-m depression of the thermocline. In addition, sea level rose by 10 dyn cm from mid-November to mid-December between 1S and 3N, 165E. Sea surface temperature dropped over a large region by 0.2-0.5C during episodes of high westerly winds, and some episodes of high winds were associated with 0.2-0.3C sea surface temperature inversions supported by salt-stratified buoyancy gradients in the upper 100 m. The near-surface salinity balance was dominated by lateral advection when relatively fresh water from north of a salinity front centered near 3N was advected southward by Ekman drift in late November 1989. Displacement of this front past a current meter mooring at 0, 165E, appeared as a local drop of 1 psu in surface layer salinity in 10 days. These results are discussed in the context of a swing in the climate system towards El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation-like conditions in early 1990.},

  abstract  = {The Indian Ocean is unique among the three tropical ocean basins in that it is blocked at 25$\deg$N by the Asian landmass. Seasonal heating and cooling of the land sets the stage for dramatic monsoon wind reversals, strong ocean-atmosphere interactions, and intense seasonal rains over the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and Australia. Recurrence of these monsoon rains is critical to agricultural production that supports a third of the world's population. The Indian Ocean also remotely influences the evolution of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), North American weather, and hurricane activity. Despite its importance in the regional and global climate system though, the Indian Ocean is the most poorly observed and least well understood of the three tropical oceans. This article describes the Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA), a new observational network designed to address outstanding scientific questions related to Indian Ocean variability and the monsoons. RAMA is a multinationally supported element of the Indian Ocean Observing System (IndOOS), a combination of complementary satellite and in situ measurement platforms for climate research and forecasting. The article discusses the scientific rationale, design criteria, and implementation of the array. Initial RAMA data are presented to illustrate how they contribute to improved documentation and understanding of phenomena in the region. Applications of the data for societal benefit are also described. *Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory Publication Number 3199 and National Institute of Oceanography Contribution Number 4437},

  abstract  = {Large-eddy simulations are made for the canonical Ekman layer problem of a steady wind above a uniformly rotating, constant-density ocean. The focus is on the influence of surface gravity waves: namely, the wave-averaged Stokes-Coriolis and Stokes-vortex forces and parameterized wave breaking for momentum and energy injection. The wave effects are substantial: the boundary layer is deeper, the turbulence is stronger, and eddy momentum flux is dominated by breakers and Langmuir circulations with a vertical structure inconsistent with both the conventional logarithmic layer and eddy viscosity relations. The surface particle mean drift is dominated by Stokes velocity with Langmuir circulations playing a minor role. Implications are assessed for parameterization of the mean velocity profile in the Ekman layer with wave effects by exploring several parameterization ideas. The authors find that the K-profile parameterization (KPP) eddy viscosity is skillful for the interior of the Ekman layer with wave-enhanced magnitude and depth scales. Furthermore, this parameterization form is also apt in the breaker and Stokes layers near the surface when it is expressed as a Lagrangian eddy viscosity (i.e., turbulent Reynolds stress proportional to vertical shear of the Lagrangian mean flow, inclusive of Stokes drift) with a derived eddy-viscosity shape and with a diagnosed vertical profile of a misalignment angle between Reynolds stress and Lagrangian mean shear.},

  abstract = {A multi-scale asymptotic theory is derived for the evolution and interaction of currents and surface gravity waves in water of finite depth, under conditions typical of coastal shelf waters outside the surf zone. The theory provides a practical and useful model with which wave--current coupling may be explored without the necessity of resolving features of the flow on space and time scales of the primary gravity-wave oscillations. The essential nature of the dynamical interaction is currents modulating the slowly evolving phase of the wave field and waves providing both phase-averaged forcing of long infra-gravity waves and wave-averaged vortex and Bernoulli-head forces and hydrostatic static set-up for the low-frequency current and sea-level evolution equations. Analogous relations are derived for wave-averaged material tracers and density stratification that include advection by horizontal Stokes drift and by a vertical Stokes pseudo-velocity that is the incompressible companion to the horizontal Stokes velocity. Illustrative solutions are analysed for the special case of depth-independent currents and tracers associated with an incident surface wave field and a vortex with O(1) Rossby number above continental shelf topography.},

As a result of numerical modelling applied to the evolution of tropospheric meso- and macro-scale wave sources, the values of these forcing terms are estimated. A three-dimensional numerical simulation of wave propagation from a mesometeorological tropospheric eddy into the upper atmosphere was done to estimate the gravity wave response to the sources described. The results of the calculations show that the most part of the wave energy propagates quasi-horizontally carried by two-dimensional inertio-gravity waves. At the same time, a part of the energy is transported into the upper atmosphere by internal-gravity waves which can create regions of wave disturbance in the upper atmosphere at considerable distances from the source site. The amplitudes of these waves increase with increasing intensity and decreasing time scales of the wave sources and can reach the values observed in the upper atmosphere.},

An eddy-resolving ocean model is used to investigate the delay between wind forcing and the eddy response, and demonstrates that the lag is due to the time taken to influence the deep circulation of the ACC. Winds over the Southern Ocean have shown a strong climatic increase over the past few decades. If this increase in winds is also reflected as an increase in eddy activity (as our analysis suggests it might), then the increased poleward heat flux may have played a significant role in the observed warming of the Southern Ocean.},

The data suggest that the near-inertial currents interact with the mesoscale vorticity. To explore the exact nature of this relationship, an asymptotic analysis is extended to include the mesoscale and it is shown that not only gradients in the planetary vorticity () but also the gradients in the mesoscale vorticity affect the generation and evolution of near-inertial mixed layer currents. While the effect is relevant for the large-scale evolution of the near-inertial currents, the vorticity gradients of the mesoscale field determine the local behavior of near-inertial currents. Using a three-dimensional model it is shown that areas of large gradients in the mesoscale vorticity coincide with areas of low near-inertial energy. The smaller spatial scales in the near-inertial energy, generated by the vorticity field, result in faster decay of near-inertial currents. The findings that the near-inertial currents interact with the mesoscale are in apparent contradiction with previous research in the same area. },

  abstract = {We analyse a low-dimensional model for turbulent shear flows. The model is based on Fourier modes and describes sinusoidal shear flow, in which the fluid between two free-slip walls experiences a sinusoidal body force. The model contains a total of nine modes, including modes describing the basic mean velocity profile and its modification, downstream vortices, streaks, and instabilities of streaks, with other modes being a consequence of the non-linear interactions. The transition to turbulence for the model is subcritical and intermittent, and the distributions of turbulent lifetimes are exponential, in agreement with observations in many shear flows.},

  abstract = {The Southern Ocean is a climatically sensitive region that plays an important role in the regional and global modulation of atmospheric CO2. Based on satellite-derived sea ice data, wind and cloudiness estimates from numerical models (National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis), and in situ measurements of surface (0-20 m depth) chlorophyll a (ChlSurf) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DICSurf) concentration, we show sea ice concentration from June to November and spring wind patterns between 1979 and 2006 had a significant influence on midsummer (January) primary productivity and carbonate chemistry for the Western Shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP, 64-68S, 63.4-73.3W). In general, strong (>3.5 m s-1) and persistent (>2 months) northerly winds during the previous spring were associated with relatively high (monthly mean > 2 mg m-3) ChlSurf and low (monthly mean < 2 mmol kg-1) salinity-corrected DIC (DICSurf*) during midsummer. The greater ChlSurf accumulation and DICSurf* depletion was attributed to an earlier growing season characterized by decreased spring sea ice cover or nearshore accumulation of phytoplankton in association with sea ice. The impact of these wind-driven mechanisms on ChlSurf and DICSurf* depended on the extent of sea ice area (SIA) during winter. Winter SIA affected phytoplankton blooms by changing the upper mixed layer depth (UMLD) during the subsequent spring and summer (December-January-February). Midsummer DICSurf* was not related to DICSurf* concentration during the previous summer, suggesting an annual replenishment of surface DIC during fall/winter and a relatively stable pool of deep (>200 m depth) winter-like DIC on the WAP.},

  abstract = {Abstract Satellite altimetry has previously been used to map the magnitude of the surface eddy variability of the global oceans, but the direction of the time-variable velocities have been more difficult to determine. Here, a technique is presented for resolving both magnitude and direction of residual surface geostrophic velocities at Geosat altimeter crossover points; providing a two-year time series with a temporal resolution of 17 days and horizontal resolution of around 100 km. The time series of residual velocity components are then used to determine surface eddy statistics in the Southern Ocean and to investigate the role of transient eddies in the Southern Ocean momentum balance. The surface eddy statistics from Geosat crossover points show a complex spatial distribution in the surface Reynolds stresses (u, v, uv). In contrast to the assumptions of isotropic variability in previous analyses of altimeter data, velocity variance ellipses are found to be distinctly anisotropic in many regions. The surface eddy statistics compare favorably with the available in situ current meter data and surface drifter data. The complex spatial distribution of surface eddy momentum flux is strongly influenced by bottom topography and the position of the mean current. On a zonal average, the horizontal divergence of eddy momentum flux from transient eddies is found to be around two orders of magnitude too small to directly balance the eastward momentum from the wind. In the Agulhas Return Current and near the Macquarie Ridge/Campbell Plateau, the Reynolds stress are significant and they act to concentrate the mean jet, in agreement with recent numerical models. However, circumpolar streamwise averages along paths parallel to the mean axis of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current show only a small net convergence.},

His discoveries have remained a focus of hydrodynamic stability for the intervening 125 years, and the central puzzle of why the transition takes place at all remains unresolved. It is an enigma as all theoretical and numerical evidence suggests that the base state of fully developed flow, Hagen-Poiseuille flow, is linearly stable. The transition to turbulence is abrupt, mysterious, and largely dependent on the quality of the facility used in any experimental investigation. It is therefore not an example of transition via a sequence of instabilities or bifurcations in which considerable success has been achieved over the same period. Despite wide-ranging research activity that has uncovered many important pieces of the jigsaw, the central puzzle remains unresolved. The purpose of this review is to bring together the available experimental evidence and attempt to extract a set of accepted facts about this important problem. },

This record shows a clear increase in the magnitude of the sea-air pCO2 gradient, indicating strengthening of the CO2 sink in agreement with recent large-scale analyses of the world oceans. The rate of increase in pCO2surf north of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) is similar to the atmospheric pCO2 (pCO2atm) trend, whereas the pCO2surf increase south of the APF is slower than the pCO2atm trend. The high-frequency surface observations indicate that an absence of a winter increase in total CO2 (TCO2) and cooling summer sea surface temperatures are largely responsible for increasing CO2 uptake south of the APF. Muted winter trends in surface TCO2 also provide temporary stability to the carbonate system that is already close to undersaturation with respect to aragonite.},

One- to two-year record length mean balances are approximately linear and steady state. Monthly to seasonal time scale variations are also governed by linear dynamics, with imbalances between the pressure gradient force and surface wind stress leading to zonal mass transport variations along the equator. Interannual variations in zonal transports along the equator associated with Indian Ocean Dipole events in 1994 and 2006 are likewise consistent with linear dynamics. These results provide a valuable benchmark for evaluating models of equatorial Indian Ocean circulation on seasonal time scales.},

The results suggest that the evaporation-wind feedback can be important to the amplitude of the spectral peak corresponding to the 30?50 day oscillation in the model, but that the existence of the oscillation does not depend on it. The feedback is found to have a much more dramatic effect on low-frequency variability when sea surface temperatures are fixed than when the lower boundary is a zero heat capacity ?swamp?.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the coupling between a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model, the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model. The primary motivation for developing this coupled model has been to reduce transport errors in continental-scale top--down estimates of terrestrial greenhouse gas fluxes. Examples of the model's application are shown here for backward trajectory computations originating at CO2 measurement sites in North America. Owing to its unique features, including meteorological realism and large support base, good mass conservation properties, and a realistic treatment of convection within STILT, the WRF--STILT model offers an attractive tool for a wide range of applications, including inverse flux estimates, flight planning, satellite validation, emergency response and source attribution, air quality, and planetary exploration.},

  abstract = {Measurements of air-sea gas exchange rates are reported from two deliberate tracer experiments in the southern North Sea during February 1992 and 1993. A conservative tracer, spores of the bacterium Bacillus globigii var. Niger, was used for the first time in an in situ air-sea gas exchange experiment. This nonvolatile tracer is used to correct for dispersive dilution of the volatile tracers and allows three estimations of the transfer velocity for the same time period. The first estimation of the power dependence of gas transfer on molecular diffusivity in the marine environment is reported. This allows the impact of bubbles on estimates of the transfer velocity derived from changes in the helium/sulphur hexafluoride ratio to be assessed. Data from earlier dual tracer experiments are reinterpreted, and findings suggest that results from all dual tracer experiments are mutually consistent. The complete data set is used to test published parameterizations of gas transfer with wind speed. A gas ex- change relationship that shows a dependence on wind speed intermediate between those ofLiss and Merlivat [1986] and Wanninkhof [1992] is found to be optimal. The dual tracer data are shown to be reasonably consistent with global estimates of gas exchange based on the uptake of natural and bomb-derived radiocarbon. The degree of scatter in the data when plotted against wind speed suggests that parameters not scaling with wind speed are also influencing gas exchange rates.},

This time series of dissipation measurements at a fixed site and with a wide range of wind speeds indicates that a constant fraction of the energy flux in the atmospheric boundary layer appears as dissipation in the mixed layer. Our measured velocity-shear spectra are consistent in shape with an isotropic-turbulence spectral form and simultaneous determinations of spectral level from two mutually perpendicular sensors are consistent with isotropy. Significant changes in turbulence levels between two profiles a few minutes apart are observed. These changes (often a factor of 10) emphasize the necessity of adequate space-time averaging to obtain good mean values of ?. Including data from measurements of the large-scale density and velocity fields, the generation of the observed turbulence is thought to be Richardson-number instabilities in the mixed layer rather than direct surface phenomena such as wave breaking.},

  abstract  = {Stratified shear flows occur in many geophysical contexts, from oceanic overflows and river estuaries to wind-driven thermocline layers.
We explore a turbulent wall-bounded shear flow of lighter miscible fluid into a quiescent fluid of higher density with a range of Richardson numbers {$0.05\lesssim Ri\lesssim 1$}.
In order to find a stability parameter that allows close comparison with linear theory and with idealized experiments and numerics, we investigate different definitions of {$Ri$}.
We find that a gradient Richardson number defined on fluid interface sections where there is no overturning at or adjacent to the maximum density gradient position provides an excellent stability parameter, which captures the Miles-Howard linear stability criterion. For small {$Ri$} the flow exhibits robust Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, whereas for larger {$Ri$} interfacial overturning is more intermittent with less frequent Kelvin-Helmholtz events and emerging Holmboe wave instability consistent with a thicker velocity layer compared with the density layer. We compute the perturbed fraction of interface as a quantitative measure of the flow intermittency, which is approximately 1 for the smallest {$Ri$} but decreases rapidly as {$Ri$} increases, consistent with linear theory. For the perturbed regions, we use the Thorpe scale to characterize the overturning properties of these flows. The probability distribution of the non-zero Thorpe length yields a universal exponential form, suggesting that much of the overturning results from increasingly intermittent Kelvin-Helmholtz instability events. The distribution of turbulent kinetic energy, conditioned on the intermittency fraction, has a similar form, suggesting an explanation for the universal scaling collapse of the Thorpe length distribution.},

Here we report on simulations using NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 (GEOS-5) which was used to evaluate the consistency of two different sets of observationally informed land and ocean fluxes with atmospheric CO2 records. Despite the observation inputs, the average difference in annual terrestrial biosphere flux between the two land (NASA Ames Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) and CASA-Global Fire Emissions Database version 3 (GFED)) models is 1.7 Pg C for 2009-2010. Ocean models (NASA's Ocean Biogeochemical Model (NOBM) and Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean Phase II (ECCO2)-Darwin) differ by 35% in their global estimates of carbon flux with particularly strong disagreement in high latitudes. Based upon combinations of terrestrial and ocean fluxes, GEOS-5 reasonably simulated the seasonal cycle observed at Northern Hemisphere surface sites and by the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) while the model struggled to simulate the seasonal cycle at Southern Hemisphere surface locations. Though GEOS-5 was able to reasonably reproduce the patterns of XCO2 observed by GOSAT, it struggled to reproduce these aspects of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder observations. Despite large differences between land and ocean flux estimates, resulting differences in atmospheric mixing ratio were small, typically less than 5 ppm at the surface and 3 ppm in the XCO2 column. A statistical analysis based on the variability of observations shows that flux differences of these magnitudes are difficult to distinguish from inherent measurement variability, regardless of the measurement platform.},

  abstract = {`Bioconvection' is the name given to pattern-forming convective motions set up in suspensions of swimming micro-organisms. `Gyrotaxis' describes the way the swimming is guided through a balance between the physical torques generated by viscous drag and by gravity operating on an asymmetric distribution of mass within the organism. When the organisms are heavier towards the rear, gyrotaxis turns them so that they swim towards regions of most rapid downflow. The presence of gyrotaxis means that bioconvective instability can develop from an initially uniform suspension, without an unstable density stratification. In this paper a continuum model for suspensions of gyrotactic micro-organisms is proposed and discussed; in particular, account is taken of the fact that the organisms of interest are non-spherical, so that their orientation is influenced by the strain rate in the ambient flow as well as the vorticity. This model is used to analyse the linear instability of a uniform suspension. It is shown that the suspension is unstable if the disturbance wavenumber is less than a critical value which, together with the wavenumber of the most rapidly growing disturbance, is calculated explicitly. The subsequent convection pattern is predicted to be three-dimensional (i.e. with variation in the vertical as well as the horizontal direction) if the cells are sufficiently elongated. Numerical results are given for suspensions of a particular algal species (Chlamydomonas nivalis); the predicted wavelength of the most rapidly growing disturbance is 5\&ndash;6 times larger than the wavelength of steady-state patterns observed in experiments. The main reasons for the difference are probably that the analysis describes the onset of convection, not the final, nonlinear steady state, and that the experimental fluid layer has finite depth.},

  abstract = {The data for the spectrums of fully developed seas obtained by Moskowitz [1964] for wind speeds from 20 to 40 knots (10.29 to 20.58 m/sec), are used to test the similarity hypothesis and the idea proposed by Kitaigorodskii [1961] that, when plotted in a certain dimensionless way, the power spectrums for all fully developed seas should be of the same shape. Over the important range of frequencies that define the total variance of the spectrum within a few per cent, the transformed plots yield a nondimensional spectral form that is nearly the same over this entire range of wind speeds within the present accuracies of the data. However, since slight variations of the wind speed have large effects on the location of this nondimensional spectral form, inaccuracies in the determination of the wind speed at sea allow for some latitude in the final choice of the form of the spectrum. Also, since the winds used to obtain the nondimensional form were measured at a height greater than 10 meters, the problem of relating the spectral form to a standard anemometer height arises. The variability introduced by this factor needs to be considered. The results, when errors in the wind speed, the sampling variability of the data, and the anemometer heights are considered, suggest a spectral form that is a compromise between the various proposed spectrums and that has features similar to many of them. A spectral form is recommended for tentative application to the problem of wave forecasting by spectral techniques. Improved wind speed measurements (taken at several elevations and averaged over longer time intervals) and better wave data (taken for longer time intervals and analyzed so as to better fit the procedures) are needed so that the form of the spectrums of fully developed wind seas and seas limited by either fetch or duration can be determined with even greater precision.},

  abstract = {A cooperative, multiplatform field experiment was conducted in the eastern North Pacific during February and March of 1990 as part of the Surface Waves Processes Program (SWAPP). One of the experimental objectives was to investigate Langmuir circulation so that its role in the evolution of the oceanic surface boundary layer could be better understood. The concurrent use of different observational techniques, ranging from simple surface drifters to complex Doppler sonar systems, resulted in new information about Langmuir circulation structure and variability. Estimates of Langmuir cell spacing indicated that a broad range of scales, from about 2 to 200 m, was excited during periods of strong surface forcing and that the energy containing scales evolved with time. Estimates of cell spacing based on Doppler velocities from a surface-scanning sonar directed crosswind showed this scale evolution, but estimates based on backscattered intensity did not. This was attributed to the fact that the intensity-based estimates were only indirectly related to circulation strength. The near-surface convergent velocities from the sonar were used to form an objective, quantitative measure of the temporal variations in Langmuir circulation strength. As expected, the circulation strength increased dramatically during strong wind events. However, circulation strength and wind stress did not decrease simultaneously, and Langmuir circulation was detectable for up to a day after abrupt reductions in wind stress. Energy from the surface wave field, which decayed more slowly than the wind, was apparently responsible for maintaining the circulation. The variation of circulation strength was found to be better related to (u*Us) than to u*, where u* = is the friction velocity, is the wind stress, and Us is the surface wave Stokes drift. This scaling is consistent with wave-current interaction theories of Langmuir cell generation.},

  abstract = {The influence of surface waves and an applied wind stress is studied in an ensemble of large eddy simulations to investigate the nature of deeply penetrating jets into an unstratified mixed layer. The influence of a steady monochromatic surface wave propagating parallel to the wind direction is parameterized using the wave-filtered Craik-Leibovich equations. Tracer trajectories and instantaneous downwelling velocities reveal classic counterrotating Langmuir rolls. The associated downwelling jets penetrate to depths in excess of the wave's Stokes depth scale, $\delta_\text{s}$. Qualitative evidence suggests the depth of the jets is controlled by the Ekman depth scale. Analysis of turbulent kinetic energy (tke) budgets reveals a dynamical distinction between Langmuir turbulence and shear-driven turbulence. In the former, tke production is dominated by Stokes shear and a vertical flux term transports tke to a depth where it is dissipated. In the latter, tke production is from the mean shear and is locally balanced by dissipation. We define the turbulent Langmuir number Lat = (v*/Us)0.5 (v* is the ocean's friction velocity and Us is the surface Stokes drift velocity) and a turbulent anisotropy coefficient Rt = /( + ). The transition between shear-driven and Langmuir turbulence is investigated by varying external wave parameters $\delta_\text{s}$ and Lat and by diagnosing Rt and the Eulerian mean and Stokes shears. When either Lat or $\delta_\text{s}$ are sufficiently small the Stokes shear dominates the mean shear and the flow is preconditioned to Langmuir turbulence and the associated deeply penetrating jets.},

  abstract  = {The climatological seasonal cycle of the upper equatorial Indian Ocean is discussed. A summary of the observations is given. Near the surface and below the equatorial thermocline, the observations indicate an intense variability of the equatorial currants, primarily at the semiannual frequency. In the thermocline, an eastward flowing equatorial undercurrent present in March and April is the dominant feature. An analysis of the temperature profiles in the upper 500 meters also indicates at all depths, seasonal vertical displacements well above the estimated uncertainty. At the semiannual period, the different isotherms are oscillating in phase in the upper western Indian Ocean and an upward phase propagation is present in the east. Displacements at the annual period have shorter spatial scales and are usually smaller, the near surface and the deeper oceans am separated at this period by a level of no displacements in the upper thermocline. The equatorial thickening of the thermocline in March-April in the central and western Indian Ocean also suggests the presence of an eastward flowing undercurrent at that time. To investigate the dynamics, a simplified wind forced linear model in the equatorial beta-plane is presented for a stratified Indian Ocean. The wind stress is applied as a body force over a mixed layer of specified thickness and below a dynamically induced mixing is included. A decomposition in vertical modes is done and the lower modes are solved with a numerical scheme from Cane and Patton. The dynamics of the higher modes are characterized by Yoshida jets (negligible zonal gradients) and an approximate solution is sought for them. The model response to wind forcing is sensitive to thew hypotheses with the surface equatorial currants being strongly dependent on the mixed layer depth and with the currents in the thermocline being controlled by mixing. The model reproduces many of the most salient characteristics of the observed seasonal cycle, both for the currents and the isotherm vertical displacement. As in earlier studies, this suggests that the wind stress near the equator is an important forcing of the equatorial Indian Ocean, at least to depths of 500 m. However, typical differences between the observed seasonal cycle and the modeled one are of the order of 10 days in phase and a factor 1.5 in amplitude. Sensitivity studies suggest that these differences could not be overcome by tuning the model adjustable parameters, but that they are likely to arise from the crude representation of the forcing as a body force and the neglect of the nonlinearities.},

During 1983--1985 the Lagrangian circulation was studied by launching and tracking 30 freely drifting drogued buoys in the North Equatorial Countercurrent and 23 in the South Equatorial Current (SEC). In addition, continuously recording current meters were moored for 20 months at depths from 20 to 300 m near the center of the NECC, at 6$\deg$N, 28$\deg$W. These measurements are the longest series ever obtained in this current and provide information about its seasonal and interannual variations and zonal, meridional, and vertical structure. The seasonal cycle of the NECC is very regular from year to year. Each year the NECC starts up in May--June. It flows eastward across the Atlantic with surface speeds of up to 143 cm/s in the west, extending down to 350 m at 28$\deg$W, and flowing into both the Guinea Current and North Equatorial Current. It disappears or reverses from about January--June west of 18$\deg$W. Some near-surface water of the NECC is inferred to downwell and flow equatorward toward the Equatorial Undercurrent. The SEC flows into the North Brazil Current, which during spring continues up the coast into the Caribbean. During fall, however, the whole North Brazil Current retroflects, or turns back on itself, between 45$\deg$ and 50$\deg$W, forming the western NECC. The retroflection establishes a meander pattern in the NECC that slowly propagates westward during fall at a speed of 4 cm/s. The meanders have a displacement of about 300 km in latitude, a wavelength of 900 km, and meridional velocity fluctuations of up to 100 cm/s. The swift currents and time-dependent meanders in the western NECC cause a high eddy kinetic energy, $\sim$2400 cm2/s2, equivalent to that of the energetic part of the Gulf Stream.},

The response of an initially resting ocean to WWB forcing is compared with that for model oceans that are spun up with annual-mean surface fluxes and monthly varying fluxes. It is demonstrated that the gross features of the response for the spun up simulations can be well approximated by adding the background zonal current structure prior to the introduction of the wind burst to the initially resting ocean current response to the WWB. This result suggests that the zonal current structure that is present prior to the commencement of WWB forcing plays a key role in determining whether or not a SSWJ will develop.

It is demonstrated that the gross features of the response for the spun up simulations can be well approximated by adding the background zonal current structure prior to the introduction of the wind burst to the initially resting ocean current response to the WWB. This result suggests that the zonal current structure that is present prior to the commencement of WWB forcing plays a key role in determining whether or not a SSWJ will develop.},

  abstract = {In an effort to measure current shear very near the sea surface a string of vector-measuring current meters suspended beneath a surface float was deployed 180 km off southern California at 34N 121?30W on November 26, 1981 and allowed to drift freely for over 6 days. This arrangement, which we call the current meter drifter (CMD), gave measurements at depths of 2.5, 5.5, 8.5, 11.5, 14.5, 25, and 63 m. During the first two days, when the winds were light (8 m/s) and variable in direction, a nearly uniform current shear was observed in the upper 15 m with a low-frequency velocity difference of 5 cm/s between the instruments at 2.5 and 14.5 m. During the last four days, when the winds were brisk (> 12 m/s) and steady in direction from the NNW, a strong downwind shear of order 10?2 s?1 was observed in the upper 10 m with a velocity difference of 7 cm/s between the instruments at 2.5 and 8.5 m. During this same period the shear below 10 m was much smaller. The average currents during the CMD drift veer to the right of the wind stress with angular displacement increasing with depth. Time series of the velocity difference between 2.5 and 5.5 m compare very well with (t)u*?1 ln (5.5/2.5), where?(t) is the wind direction vector (of unit magnitude), u* = (wind stress is the friction velocity in water, and  = 0.4 is von Karman's constant. On the other hand, a similar comparison of the velocity difference between 5.5 and 8.5 m to (t)u*?1 In (8.5/5.5) is much poorer with observed velocity difference being much larger, possibly due to stable stratification effects. Possible errors in the measurements have been considered and estimated as less than the observed velocity differences. Near-surface shears as large as the observed are very important in closing the momentum budget for the oceanic boundary layer.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we review observations, theory and model results on the monsoon circulation of the Indian Ocean. We begin with a general overview, discussing wind-stress forcing fields and their anomalies, climatological distributions of stratification, mixed-layer depths, altimetric sea-level distributions, and seasonal circulation patterns (Section 2). The three main monsoon circulation sections deal with the equatorial regime (Section 3), the Somali Current and western Arabian Sea (Section 4), and the Bay of Bengal, seasonally reversing monsoon currents south of India and Sri Lanka, and the eastern and central Arabian Sea (Section 5). For the equatorial regime, we discuss equatorial jets and undercurrents, their interactions with the eastern and western boundaries, and intraseasonal and vertically propagating signals. In the Somali Current section, we describe the ocean's responses to the summer and winter monsoon winds, and outline the modelling efforts that have been carried out to understand them. In the Bay of Bengal section, we present observational and modeling evidence showing the importance of remote forcing from the east, which to a large extent originates along the equator. In the following three sections, we review the southern-hemisphere subtropical regime and its associated boundary currents (Section 6), the Indonesian Throughflow (Section 7), the Red Sea and Persian Gulf circulations (Section 8), and discuss aspects of their interactions with other Indian-Ocean circulations. Next, we describe the Indian Ocean's deep and shallow meridional overturning cells (Section 9). Model results show large seasonal variability of the meridional overturning streamfunction and heat flux, and we discuss possible physical mechanisms behind this variability. While the monsoon-driven variability of the deep cell is mostly a sloshing motion affecting heat storage, interesting water-mass transformations and monsoonal reversals occur in the shallow cross-equatorial cell. In the mean, the shallow cell connects the subduction areas in the southern subtropics and parts of the Indonesian Throughflow waters with the upwelling areas of the northern hemisphere via the cross-equatorial Somali Current. Its near-surface branch includes a shallow equatorial roll that is seasonally reversing. We close by looking at coupled ocean-climate anomalies, in particular the large events that were observed in the tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean in 1993/94 and 1997/98. These events have been interpreted as an independent Indian-Ocean climate mode by some investigators and as an ENSO-forced anomaly by others. },

This paper reviews climate phenomena and processes in which the IO is, or appears to be, actively involved. We begin with an update of the IO mean circulation and monsoon system. It is followed by reviews of ocean/atmosphere phenomenon at intraseasonal, interannual, and longer time scales. Much of our review addresses the two important types of interannual variability in the IO, El Ni{\~{n}}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the recently identified Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). IOD events are often triggered by ENSO but can also occur independently, subject to eastern tropical preconditioning. Over the past decades, IO sea surface temperatures and heat content have been increasing, and model studies suggest significant roles of decadal trends in both the Walker circulation and the Southern Annular Mode. Prediction of IO climate variability is still at the experimental stage, with varied success. Essential requirements for better predictions are improved models and enhanced observations.},

WWBs were detected over the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, but not over the Atlantic Ocean. WWB frequencies for each region were lag correlated with a sea surface temperature anomaly over the Ni{\~n}o-3 region.

These results suggest that WWB occurrences are not random, but interactive with ENSO. Composite analysis revealed that most WWBs were associated with slowdowns of eastward-propagating convective regions like the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), with the intensified Rossby wave response. However, seasonal and interannual variations in MJO amplitude were not correlated with WWB frequency, while a strong MJO event tended to bear WWBs. It is suggested that the strong MJO amplitude promotes favorable conditions, but it is not the only factor influencing WWB frequency. An environment common to WWB generation in all regions was the existence of background westerlies around the WWB center near the equator. It is inferred that ENSO prepares a favorable environment for the structural transformation of an MJO, that is, the intensified Rossby wave response, that results in WWB generations. The role of the background wind fields on WWB generations will be discussed in a companion paper from the perspective of energetics.

  abstract  = {Abstract The mechanism of synoptic-scale eddy development in the generation of westerly wind bursts (WWBs) over the western-central Pacific, and their relationship with the El Ni Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), were examined. In the WWB occurrences, barotropic structures of equatorial eddy westerlies with cyclonic disturbances were found from the surface to the upper troposphere. The dominant contributions to substantial eddy kinetic energy (EKE) were the barotropic energy conversion (KmKe) in the lower and middle tropospheres and the conversion from eddy available potential energy (PeKe) in the upper troposphere. Low-frequency environmental westerlies centered near the equator preceded strong zonal convergence and meridional shear, resulting in the substantial KmKe. The activation of synoptic convection also contributed to an increase in EKE through PeKe. These energies were redistributed to the lower-equatorial troposphere through energy flux convergence (GKe). These results showed that environmental fields contribute to the EKE increase near the equator and are important factors in WWB occurrences. Next, eddy growth was compared under different phases of MJO and ENSO. The MJO westerly phases of strong MJO events were classified into two groups, in terms of ENSO phases. Higher EKE values were found over the equatorial central Pacific in the WWB-ENSO correlated (pre-El Ni) periods. The energetics during these periods comported with those of the WWB generations. In the uncorrelated periods, the enhancement of eddy disturbances occurred far from the equator near the Philippines, where the activities of the easterly wave disturbances are well known. It is noteworthy that the enhanced region of the disturbances in the pre El Ni periods coincided with the vicinity of large-scale MJO convection. It is suggested that coincidence corresponds with an enhancement of the internal disturbances embedded in the MJO, which is found only when the environmental conditions are favorable in association with ENSO.

Eddy stirring at scales on the order of 100 km (the mesoscale) is fairly well understood and explicitly represented in modern eddy-resolving numerical models of global ocean circulation. The same cannot be said for smaller-scale stirring processes. Here, the authors describe a major oceanographic field experiment aimed at observing and understanding the processes responsible for stirring at scales of 0.1-10 km. Stirring processes of varying intensity were studied in the Sargasso Sea eddy field approximately 250 km southeast of Cape Hatteras. Lateral variability of water-mass properties, the distribution of microscale turbulence, and the evolution of several patches of inert dye were studied with an array of shipboard, autonomous, and airborne instruments. Observations were made at two sites, characterized by weak and moderate background mesoscale straining, to contrast different regimes of lateral stirring. Analyses to date suggest that, in both cases, the lateral dispersion of natural and deliberately released tracers was O(1) m2 s-1 as found elsewhere, which is faster than might be expected from traditional shear dispersion by persistent mesoscale flow and linear internal waves. These findings point to the possible importance of kilometer-scale stirring by submesoscale eddies and nonlinear internal-wave processes or the need to modify the traditional shear-dispersion paradigm to include higher-order effects. A unique aspect of the Scalable Lateral Mixing and Coherent Turbulence (LatMix) field experiment is the combination of direct measurements of dye dispersion with the concurrent multiscale hydrographic and turbulence observations, enabling evaluation of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed dispersion at a new level.},

  abstract  = {Sea surface temperature (SST) variations associated with the atmospheric intraseasonal oscillation in the tropical Indian and western Pacific Oceans, are examined using a one-dimensional mixed layer model. Surface fluxes associated with 10 well-defined intraseasonal events from the period 1986-93 are used to force the model. Surface winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts daily analyses and SST from the mixed layer model are used to compute latent and sensible heat fluxes and wind stress with the TOGA COARE bulk flux algorithm. Surface freshwater flux is estimated from the Microwave Sounding Unit precipitation data. Net shortwave radiation is estimated, via regression analysis, from outgoing longwave radiation. An idealized diurnal cycle of shortwave radiation is also imposed. The intraseasonal SST variation from the model, when forced by the surface fluxes estimated from gridded analyses, agrees well with the SST observed at a mooring during the COARE. The model was then integrated for the 10 well-defined intraseasonal events at grid points from 75$\deg$ to 175$\deg$E at 5$\deg$S, which spans the warm pool of the equatorial Indian and western Pacific Oceans. The one-dimensional model is able to simulate the amplitude of the observed intraseasonal SST variation throughout this domain. Variations of shortwave radiation and latent heat flux are equally important for driving the SST variations in the western Pacific, while latent heat flux variations are less important in the Indian Ocean. The phasing of the intraseasonal variation of precipitation relative to wind stress results in little impact of the freshwater flux variation on the intraseasonally varying mixed layer. The diurnal cycle of shortwave radiation is found to significantly increase the intraseasonal amplitude of SST over that produced by daily mean insolation.},

  abstract = {The Bay of Bengal has a complex upper-ocean temperature and salinity structure that is, in places, characterized by strong salinity stratification and multiple inversions in temperature. Here, two short time series from continuously profiling floats, equipped with microstructure sensors to measure subsurface mixing, are used to highlight implications of complex hydrography on upper-ocean heat content and the evolution of sea surface temperature. Weak mixing coupled with the existence of subsurface warm layers suggest the potential for storage of heat below the surface mixed layer over relatively long time scales. On the diurnal time scale, these data demonstrate the competing effects of surface heat flux and subsurface mixing in the presence of thin salinity-stratified mixed layers with temperature inversions. Pre-existing stratification can amplify the sea surface temperature response through control on the vertical extent of heating and cooling by surface fluxes. In contrast, subsurface mixing entrains relatively cool water during the day and relatively warm water during the night, damping the response to daytime heating and nighttime cooling at the surface. These observations hint at the challenges involved in improving monsoon prediction at longer, intraseasonal time scales as models may need to resolve upper-ocean variability over short time and fine vertical scales.},

Results from the experiments show that the vortex force generates Langmuir circulations that can dominate vertical mixing. The simulated vertical velocity fields show linear, small-scale, coherent structures near the surface that extend downwind across the model domain. In the interior of the mixed layer, scales of motion increase to eddy sizes that are roughly equivalent to the mixed-layer depth. Cases with the vortex force have stronger circulations near the surface in contrast to cases with only heat flux and wind stress, particularly when the heat flux is positive. Calculations of the velocity variance and turbulence dissipation rates for cases with and without the vortex force, surface cooling, and wind stress indicate that wave-current interactions are a dominant mixing process in the upper mixed layer. Heat flux calculations show that the entrainment rate at the mixed-layer base can be up to two times greater when the vortex force is included. In a case with reduced wind stress, turbulence dissipation rates remained high near the surface because of the vortex force interaction with preexisting inertial currents. In deep mixed layers (250 m) the simulations show that Langmuir circulations can vertically transport water 145 m during conditions of surface heating. Observations of turbulence dissipation rates and the vertical temperature structure support the model results.},

  abstract = {A westerly wind burst observed in the warm pool of the western equatorial Pacific Ocean cooled the ocean's surface layer by about 0.8$\deg$C. Turbulent entrainment at the base of this layer caused cooling but also heating due to the reversal of the vertical temperature gradient during rain events. Consequently, the cumulative effect of turbulent entrainment was minimized. Following the wind burst, a sustained eastward surface current contributed to high current shear and turbulent dissipation rates at the top of the thermocline. As a result, most of the heat transfer into the thermocline occurred after the wind burst had ended. The cruise-averaged turbulent flux into the thermocline was 17 $\pm$ 10 W m$-$2, which suggests that the annual mean is only a few watts per square meter. The restratification of the upper ocean in the aftermath of the wind burst is accounted for partly (but not wholly) by local turbulent entrainment. Despite heavy precipitation, upper ocean salinity generally increased during the cruise. Advection appears to have been the dominant factor governing local salinity changes.},

  abstract  = {Measurements of velocity, hydrography, surface meteorology, and microstructure were made through several squall events during a westerly wind burst that occurred in the Western Pacific warm pool in December 1992. Sustained wind forcing generated a weakly stratified turbulent surface layer that extended to the top of the main thermocline. Following each rain event, freshwater formed a statically stable layer in the upper 4?12 m. The subsequent evolution of the mixing profile was strongly depth-dependent. Turbulence increased dramatically in the fresh layer adjacent to the surface but decreased in the underlying layer. The factor by which turbulence decreased following a given squall was strongly correlated with the net rainfall. The observed timescale for the decay of the turbulence was about 0.7 buoyancy periods, similar to decay times observed near the surface after sunrise. However, these decay times are significantly larger than those estimated indirectly (as the ratio of dissipation rate to turbulent kinetic energy) from turbulent patches in the thermocline. To account for the discrepancy, the authors hypothesize that turbulence production continues to act during the observed decay process, partially counteracting the effect of dissipation.},

The vibration contamination was cancelled with the Wiener filter. The experimental technique provides an effective separation between surface waves and turbulence, using the difference in spatial scales of the energy-containing surface waves and small-scale turbulence. The data are interpreted in the coordinate system fixed to the ocean surface. Under moderate and high wind-speed conditions, we observed the average dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy in the upper few meters of the ocean to be 3-20 times larger than the logarithmic layer prediction. The Craig and Banner (J. Phys. Oceanogr. 24 (1994) 2546) model of wave-enhanced turbulence with the surface roughness length from the water side z0 parameterized according to the Terray et al. (J. Phys. Oceanogr. 26 (1996) 792) formula z0=cHs provides a reasonable fit to the experimental dissipation profile, where z is the depth (defined here as the distance to the ocean surface), c[approximate]0.6, and Hs is the significant wave height. In the wave-stirred layer, however, the average dissipation profile deviates from the model (supposedly because of extensive removing of the bubble-disturbed areas close to the ocean surface). Though the scatter of individual experimental dissipation rates (10-min averages) is significant, their statistics are consistent with the Kolmogorov's concept of intermittent turbulence and with previous studies of turbulence in the upper ocean mixed layer.},

  abstract = {In a stably stratified shear layer, thin vorticity layers (&lsquo;baroclinic layers&rsquo;) are produced by buoyancy effects and strain in between the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz vortices. A two-dimensional numerical study is conducted, in order to investigate the stability of these layers. Besides the secondary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz instability, expected but never observed previously in two-dimensional numerical simulations, a new instability is also found.The influence of the Reynolds number (Re) upon the dynamics of the baroclinic layers is first studied. The layers reach an equilibrium state, whose features have been described theoretically by Corcos &amp; Sherman (1976). An excellent agreement between those predictions and the results of the numerical simulations is obtained. The baroclinic layers are found to remain stable almost up to the time the equilibrium state is reached, though the local Richardson number can reach values as low as 0.05 at the stagnation point. On the basis of the work of Dritschel et al. (1991), we show that the stability of the layer at this location is controlled by the outer strain field induced by the large-scale Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz vortices. Numerical values of the strain rate as small as 3% of the maximum vorticity of the layer are shown to stabilize the stagnation point region.When non-pairing flows are considered, we find that only for Re &le; 2000 does a secondary instability eventually amplify in the layer. (Re is based upon half the initial vorticity thickness and half the velocity difference at the horizontally oriented boundaries.) This secondary instability is not of the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz type. It develops in the neighbourhood of convectively unstable regions of the primary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz vortex, apparently once a strong jet has formed there, and moves along the baroclinic layer while amplifying. It next perturbs the layer around the stagnation point and a secondary instability, now of the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz type, is found to develop there.We next examine the influence of a pairing upon the flow behaviour. We show that this event promotes the occurrence of a secondary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz instability, which occurs for Re &ge; 400. Moreover, at high Reynolds number (&ge; 2000), secondary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz instabilities develop successively in the baroclinic layer, at smaller and smaller scales, thereby transferring energy towards dissipative scales through a mechanism eventually leading to turbulence. Because the vorticity of such a two-dimensional stratified flow is no longer conserved following a fluid particle, an analogy with three-dimensional turbulence can be drawn.},

One of the products of ERA-40 consists of six-hourly global fields of wave parameters, like significant wave height and wave period. These data have been generated with the centre's WAM wave model. From these results we have derived climatologies of important wave parameters, including significant wave height, mean wave period, and extreme significant wave heights. Particular emphasis is on the variability of these parameters, both in space and time. Besides being important for scientists studying climate change, these results are also important for engineers who have to design maritime constructions. This paper describes the ERA-40 data and gives an overview of the results derived. The results are available on a global 1.5$\deg$ $\times$ 1.5$\deg$ grid.

  abstract = {We consider the weak (small Rossby numbers) non-linear interaction between a quasi-geostrophic vortex and the Ekman flow which is produced by a uniform wind stress acting at the top of the mixed layer. The differential advection of geostrophic vorticity by the undisturbed Ekman components tends to tilt the axis of the vortex away from the vertical but, because of the strong rotational constraint, the vortex maintians vertical {\textquoteleft}rigidity{\textquoteright} by developing vertical velocities which balance the advective tendency (and frictional rotation). In this approximate vorticity balance for a {\textquoteleft}frictional{\textquoteright} component of the total motion, the vertical integral implies a net vertical velocity ({\textquoteleft}Ekman suction{\textquoteright}) at the free surface. To maintain the proper boundary condition an equal and opposite velocity must be applied to a second (geostrophic) component of the motion. This coupling condition has been determined as a function of the surface wind stress, the gradient of geostrophic vorticity, and the depth of the homogeneous mixed layer. If the base of the mixed layer were rigid the vortex would move as a unit with the velocity of the mean Ekman drift. The suction velocity formula is then generalized to include the special case (Charney 1955) of a global wind variation and variable Coriolis parameter (Sverdrup 1947). The effect of the local wind in supplying kinetic energy to the deeper ocean is also discussed, and suggestions are made for including the baroclinicity of the friction layer into the geostrophic dynamics.},

The inner shelf is the transition between the nearshore and mid-shelf zones, and is defined where surface and bottom Ekman boundary layers overlap. Previous work has shown that the inner shelf in this region is rich in physical processes across many space and time scales. The goal here is to identify and quantify the dominant processes at the diurnal (24 hour) period. Diurnal tides contribute less than 10\% of the observed currents. Thus the focus is on the oceanic response to a strong (8 - 15 m/s daily maximum) along-shelf sea breeze which forces offshore surface Ekman transport, drives average upwelling velocities of 26 m/day, and cools the water column 2 -- 4 degrees/day. At 15 m (20 m) depth, measured diurnal surface transport is 36 (77) of full theoretical Ekman transport. Examination of a diurnal heat budget shows that vertical advection is the dominant process during afternoon cooling (both horizontal advection and solar insolation are sources of heat during this period), and is needed to close the heat budget to within 5\%. In contrast, during evening/early morning heating 92\% of the observed heating is explained by along-shelf advection of a temperature gradient within the upwelling shadow, much greater than the heating attributed to either solar insolation (2\%) or onshore motions (2\%). Thus, the diurnal heat budget is closed to within a few percent and explained by two-dimensional processes: vertical advection by wind-driven upwelling during cooling and along-shelf advection during heating.},

  abstract  = {Winds and waves in marine boundary layers are often in an unsettled state when fast-running swell generated by distant storms propagates into local regions and modifies the overlying turbulent fields. A large-eddy simulation (LES) model with the capability to resolve a moving sinusoidal wave at its lower boundary is developed to investigate this low-wind/fast-wave regime. It is used to simulate idealized situations with wind following and opposing fast-propagating waves (swell), and stationary bumps. LES predicts momentum transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere for wind following swell, and this can greatly modify the turbulence production mechanism in the marine surface layer. In certain circumstances the generation of a low-level jet reduces the mean shear between the surface layer and the PBL top, resulting in a near collapse of turbulence in the PBL. When light winds oppose the propagating swell, turbulence levels increase over the depth of the boundary layer and the surface drag increases by a factor of 4 compared to a flat surface. The mean wind profile, turbulence variances, and vertical momentum flux are then dependent on the state of the wave field. The LES results are compared with measurements from the Coupled Boundary Layers Air?Sea Transfer (CBLAST) field campaign. A quadrant analysis of the momentum flux from CBLAST verifies a wave age dependence predicted by the LES solutions. The measured bulk drag coefficient CD then depends on wind speed and wave state. In situations with light wind following swell, CD is approximately 50% lower than values obtained from standard bulk parameterizations that have no sea state dependence. In extreme cases with light wind and persistent swell, CD < 0.},

We study this deficiency in PBL LES solutions calculated over a range of shear and buoyancy forcing conditions. The discrepancy from similarity forms becomes larger with increasing shear and smaller buoyancy forcing, and persists even with substantial horizontal grid refinement. With strong buoyancy forcing, however, the error is negligible.},

Here we show that the onset of a bloom can also be triggered by a reduction in air-sea fluxes at the end of winter. When net cooling subsides at the end of winter, turbulent mixing becomes weak, thereby increasing the residence time of phytoplankton cells in the euphotic layer and allowing a bloom to develop. The necessary change in the air-sea flux generally precedes mixed-layer shoaling, and may provide a better indicator for the onset of the spring bloom than the mixed-layer depth alone. Our hypothesis is supported by numerical simulations and remote sensing data.},

  abstract = { Abstract Temperature and salinity profiles obtained with expendable CTD probes throughout Drake Passage between February 2002 and July 2005 are analyzed to estimate turbulent diapycnal eddy diffusivities to a depth of 1000 m. Diffusivity values are inferred from density/temperature inversions and internal wave vertical strain. Both methods reveal the same pattern of spatial variability across Drake Passage; diffusivity estimates from inversions exceed those from vertical strain by a factor of 3 over most of Drake Passage. The Polar Front (PF) separates two dynamically different regions. Strong thermohaline intrusions characterize profiles obtained north of the PF. South of the PF, stratification is determined largely by salinity, and temperature is typically unstably stratified between 100- and 600-m depth. In the upper 400 m, turbulent diapycnal diffusivities are O(10-3 m2?1) north of the PF but decrease to O(10-4 m2 s-1) or smaller south of the PF. Below 400 m diffusivities typically exceed 10-4 m2?1. Diffusivities decay weakly with depth north of the PF, whereas diffusivities increase with depth and peak near the local temperature maximum south of the PF. The meridional pattern in near-surface mixing corresponds to local maxima and minima of both wind stress and wind stress variance. Near-surface diffusivities are also found to be larger during winter months north of the PF. Wind-driven near-inertial waves, strong mesoscale eddy activity, and double-diffusive convection are suggested as possible factors contributing to observed mixing patterns. },

Laboratory experiments show that, as they develop, billows may be irregularly spaced, resulting in pairing along their length, or, more commonly, grow at different rates in patches which subsequently amalgamate. Both processes result in features described as knots, where neighbouring billows join. The tangling of billow vortices in the knots leads to local turbulence and mixing, often before turbulence develops at a smaller scale within the billows themselves. The axial coherence length of billows is limited to the along-axis distance between these knots. Such features in the atmosphere and the ocean have received little attention in spite of their possible bearing on clear-air turbulence and to heat and momentum transport. Observations of atmospheric billows suggest an axial coherence length which is of the same order as that found in the laboratory, about four billow wavelengths.},

Misalignments from 0$\deg$ to 135$\deg$ are examined and Langmuir turbulence structures are evident in all cases. The Stokes drift is modeled using a broadband empirical spectrum, and cases with and without the Coriolis effect, wind waves, and an initial mixed layer are examined. The expected scaling for the vertical velocity variance is recovered in the aligned simulations and is adapted here to the misaligned cases. The adjusted scaling projects the friction velocity (aligned with the wind stress) into the dominant axial direction of the Langmuir cells. The turbulent Langmuir number is generalized through a similar projection into the axial direction of the Langmuir cells, which reduces its value in realistic conditions. For known Langmuir cell orientations, the strength of Langmuir turbulence for misaligned cases can be estimated using the projected Langmuir number. A prediction for the angle between the wind stress and cell direction is obtained using the law of the wall; this prediction only requires the wind stress, Stokes drift, and boundary layer depth. Conditional analyses show that, with increasing misalignment, the typically antisymmetric Langmuir cell pairs become asymmetric. This asymmetry is due, in part, to the advection by cross cell flow of vorticity from one vortex tube onto the other, and in part due to an asymmetry induced by the stretching of vertical vorticity into cross cell vorticity.},

  abstract = {The flux Richardson number Rf (often referred to as the mixing efficiency) is a widely used parameter in stably stratified turbulence which is intended to provide a measure of the amount of turbulent kinetic energy k that is irreversibly converted to background potential energy (which is by definition the minimum potential energy that a stratified fluid can attain that is not available for conversion back to kinetic energy) due to turbulent mixing. The flux Richardson number is traditionally defined as the ratio of the buoyancy flux B to the production rate of turbulent kinetic energy P. An alternative generalized definition for Rf was proposed by Ivey & Imberger (J. Phys. Oceanogr., vol. 21, 1991, pp. 650-658), where the non-local transport terms as well as unsteady contributions were included as additional sources to the production rate of k. While this definition precludes the need to assume that turbulence is statistically stationary, it does not properly account for countergradient fluxes that are typically present in more strongly stratified flows. Hence, a third definition that more rigorously accounts for only the irreversible conversions of energy has been defined, where only the irreversible fluxes of buoyancy and production (i.e. the dissipation rates of k and turbulent potential energy (EPE)) are used. For stationary homogeneous shear flows, all of the three definitions produce identical results. However, because stationary and/or homogeneous flows are typically not found in realistic geophysical situations, clarification of the differences/similarities between these various definitions of Rf is imperative. This is especially true given the critical role Rf plays in inferring turbulent momentum and heat fluxes using indirect methods, as is commonly done in oceanography, and for turbulence closure parameterizations. To this end, a careful analysis of two existing direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of stably stratified homogeneous shear and channel flows was undertaken in the present study to compare and contrast these various definitions. We find that all three definitions are approximately equivalent when the gradient Richardson number Rig 1/4. Here, Rig=N2/S2, where N is the buoyancy frequency and S is the mean shear rate, provides a measure of the stability of the flow. However, when Rig>1/4, significant differences are noticeable between the various definitions. In addition, the irreversible formulation of Rf based on the dissipation rates of k and EPE is the only definition that is free from oscillations at higher gradient Richardson numbers. Both the traditional definition and the generalized definition of Rf exhibit significant oscillations due to the persistence of linear internal wave motions and countergradient fluxes that result in reversible exchanges between k and EPE. Finally, we present a simple parameterization for the irreversible flux Richardson number R?f based on Rig that produces excellent agreement with the DNS results for f.},

  abstract = { ABSTRACT Direct numerical simulations are used to study mixing and dispersion in decaying stably stratified turbulence from a Lagrangian perspective. The change in density of fluid particles owing to small-scale mixing is extracted from the simulations to provide insight into the mixing process. These changes are driven by temporally and spatially intermittent events that are strongly suppressed as the stratification increases and overturning motions disappear. This occurs for times $Nt \,{>}\, 2\upi$, i.e. after one buoyancy period, where $N$ is the buoyancy frequency. The role of small-scale mixing processes in the density (or buoyancy) flux is analysed. After an initial transient, we find that diapycnal displacements due to mixing dominate the dispersion of fluid particles, even in weak stratification. The relationship between the diapycnal diffusivity and vertical dispersion coefficients is found to be strongly dependent on stratification. Models for the mixing following fluid particles are investigated. The time scale for the density changes due to small-scale mixing is shown to be approximately independent of $N$ and instead remains linked to the energy decay time scale which is relatively insensitive to stratification. There are large changes in the structure of these flows as they evolve under the influence of buoyancy forces. We investigate these changes and their relationship to mixing. We find that strong mixing events are closely linked to the presence of overturning regions in the flow, and that they occur close to (but not within) these regions. The results reported here have implications for the development of improved models of diffusion in stably stratified turbulence. },

It is only recently that skill in the forecasting of the severe form of CAT, which could lead to injuries to passengers and damage to aircraft, has improved. Recent observations and simulations suggest that some severe to extreme turbulence could be caused by horizontal vortex tubes resulting from secondary instabilities of regions of high shear in the atmosphere. We have conducted direct numerical simulations to understand the scale relationship between primary structures (larger-scale structures related to one of the causes mentioned above) and secondary structures (smaller-sized, shear structures of the size of aircraft). From shear layer simulations, we find that the ratio of sizes of primary and secondary vortices is of the right order to generate aircraft-scale vortex tubes from typical atmospheric shear layers. We have also conducted simulations with a mesoscale atmospheric model, to understand possible causes of turbulence experienced by a flight off the west coast of India. Our simulations show the occurrence of primary flow structures related to synoptic conditions around the time of the incident. The evidence presented for this mechanism also has implications for possible methods of detection and avoidance of severe CAT.},

 ocean general circulation model. Virtual drifters are released in a regularly spaced pattern across the Southern Ocean at depths of 250, 500, and 1000 m during both summer and winter months. The drifters are advected along isopycnals for a period of 4 years, unless they outcrop into the mixed layer, where lateral advection and a parameterization of vertical mixing are applied. The focus of this study is on the discrete exchange between the model mixed layer and the interior. Localization of interior-mixed layer exchange occurs downstream of major topographic features across the Indian and Pacific basins, creating hotspots of outcropping. Minimal outcropping occurs in the Atlantic basin, while 59% of drifters outcrop in the Pacific sector and in Drake Passage (the region from 140 W to 40 W), a disproportionately large amount even when considering the relative basin sizes. Due to spatial and temporal variations in mixed layer depth, the Lagrangian trajectories provide a statistical measure of mixed layer residence times. For each exchange into the mixed layer, the residence time has a Rayleigh distribution with a mean of 30 days; the cumulative residence time of the drifters is 261 194 days, over a period of 4 years. These results suggest that certain oceanic gas concentrations, such as CO2 and 14C, will likely not reach equilibrium with the atmosphere before being resubducted.},

A few hundred swimming cells are observed simultaneously and the average parameters of the cells' motility are calculated. The time-dependent, two-dimensional distribution of swimming velocities is measured and the three-dimensional distribution is recovered by assuming horizontal isotropy. The mean and variance of the cell turning angle are quantified, to estimate the reorientation time and rotational diffusivity of the bottom-heavy cell. The cells' phototactic and photokinetic responses to the laser light are evaluated. The results are generally consistent both with earlier assumptions about the nature of cell swimming and quantitative measurements, appropriately adjusted. The laser-based tracking method, which makes it possible to average over a large number of motile objects, is shown to be a powerful tool for the study of microorganism motility.},

  abstract = {Turbulent mixing and energy dissipation have important roles in the global circulation but are not resolved by ocean models. We use direct numerical simulations of a geostrophic circulation, resolving turbulence and convection, to examine the rates of dissipation and mixing. As a starting point, we focus on circulation in a rotating rectangular basin forced by a surface temperature difference but no wind stress. Emphasis is on the geostrophic regime for the horizontal circulation, but also on the case of strong buoyancy forcing (large Rayleigh number), which implies a turbulent convective boundary layer. The computed results are consistent with existing scaling theory that predicts dynamics and heat transport dependent on the relative thicknesses of thermal and Ekman boundary layers, hence on the relative roles of buoyancy and rotation. Scaling theory is extended to describe the volume-integrated rate of mixing, which is proportional to heat transport and decreases with increasing rotation rate or decreasing temperature difference. In contrast, viscous dissipation depends crucially on whether the thermal boundary layer is laminar or turbulent, with no direct Coriolis effect on the turbulence unless rotation is extremely strong. For strong forcing, in the geostrophic regime, the mechanical energy input from buoyancy goes primarily into mixing rather than dissipation. For a buoyancy-driven circulation in a basin comparable to the North Atlantic we estimate that the total rate of mixing accounts for over 95% of the mechanical energy supply, implying that buoyancy is an efficient driver of mixing in the oceans.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric observations of greenhouse gases provide essential information on sources and sinks of these key atmospheric constituents. To quantify fluxes from atmospheric observations, representation of transport especially vertical mixing is a necessity and often a source of error. We report on remotely sensed profiles of vertical aerosol distribution taken over a 2 year period in Pasadena, California. Using an automated analysis system, we estimate daytime mixing layer depth, achieving high confidence in the afternoon maximum on 51% of days with profiles from a Sigma Space Mini Micropulse LiDAR (MiniMPL) and on 36% of days with a Vaisala CL51 ceilometer. We note that considering ceilometer data on a logarithmic scale, a standard method, introduces, an offset in mixing height retrievals. The mean afternoon maximum mixing height is 770m Above Ground Level in summer and 670m in winter, with significant day-to-day variance (within season = 220m 30%). Taking advantage of the MiniMPL's portability, we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the detailed horizontal structure of the mixing layer by automobile. We compare our observations to planetary boundary layer (PBL) heights from sonde launches, North American regional reanalysis (NARR), and a custom Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model developed for greenhouse gas (GHG) monitoring in Los Angeles. NARR and WRF PBL heights at Pasadena are both systematically higher than measured, NARR by 2.5 times; these biases will cause proportional errors in GHG flux estimates using modeled transport. We discuss how sustained lidar observations can be used to reduce flux inversion error by selecting suitable analysis periods, calibrating models, or characterizing bias for correction in post processing.},

Time series of near-surface meteorology from a buoy moored near the center of the COARE Intensive Flux Array (IFA) are described here. The accuracies of the measurements and the derived fluxes are quantified; agreement between average net heat fluxes at the buoy and two nearby research ships is better than 10 W m?2 during three intercomparisons. Variability in the surface meteorology and fluxes associated with westerly wind bursts, periods of low winds, and short-lived, deep convective events characteristic of the region was large compared to the 4-month means. The ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) analysis and prediction fields differed most from the buoy data during periods of short-lived, deep convective events, when several day averages of the net heat flux differed by more than 70 W m?2 and had the opposite sign. A one-dimensional ocean model run to examine the sensitivity of the upper-ocean response to differences between the observed and the ECMWF fluxes illustrates the importance of the short-lived events as well as of the wind bursts in maintaining the temperature of the warm pool.},

  abstract = {Microstructure measurements in the equatorial Pacific at 140W in late 1984 show a pronounced diurnal variation in both high-frequency internal wave energy and kinetic energy dissipation rate. Observations indicated that after sunset, internal waves (presumably generated by convective overturns in the mixed layer) propagate downward and increase turbulence levels in the pycnocline. It is proposed that large mixed layer eddies in the South Equatorial Current interact with the large shear caused by the Equatorial Undercurrent to generate a westward going anisotropic wave field. The momentum transport in the radiated wave field results in a drag force on the equatorial mean flow field. The observed mean wind stress at 140W during Tropic Heat I (which is twice as large as the annual mean wind) is closer to the estimated radiation stress (10-4 m2 s-2) at the base of the mixed layer (30 m) than to the estimated turbulent stress (10-5m2 s-2). A wave dissipation model based on the observed turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate is introduced in order to estimate the wave momentum flux divergence in the stratified region above the undercurrent core. The model predicts that most of the downward wave momentum flux penetrates through the undercurrent core. It is hypothesized that when the wind stress is strong, the equatorial Pacific Ocean responds by generating a westward traveling internal wave field which transports much of the surface wind stress below the actively mixing surface layer.},

During our stay, we observed two westerly wind bursts with maximum speeds of about 10 m 1, rainfalls of about 20 mm h-1, and nearly 2 weeks of calm and dry weather. During wind bursts, mixing in the upper 1 MPa was dramatic and rapid, and the major turbulence in the thermocline was produced by near-inertial shears following the wind bursts, during which dissipation rates and Richardson numbers were comparable to those in the central Pacific. By the end of the October-November westerly burst, the averaged eddy diffusivity of momentum in the mixed layer was about 10-2 m2 s-1. Below the mixed layer, a layer about 0.50-0.75 MPa thick with high shear and strain along with a high dissipation rate persisted even after the wind burst. During calm days, mixing was primarily driven by nighttime convection and was confined to the upper 0.1 or 0.2 MPa. In general, no diurnal deep cycle in dissipation rate was found below the mixed layer, unlike in the central equatorial Pacific. Entrainment below the mixed layer occurred when both wind work and convection were large. On average, the entrainment heat flux at the base of the mixed layer was about 6 (2) W m-2. Salinity gradients were important to density between 0.3 and 0.6 MPa. However, the salinity stratification did not control entrainment mixing. During calm and dry weather, the mixed layer heat content was governed by the vertical divergence of the radiative flux, that is, the net surface heat flux minus the radiative flux out the bottom of the layer. Both the entrainment flux and the advective flux (which was estimated as the residual term) were smaller than uncertainties in the surface heat flux. During the October-November wind burst, however, the advective term was one of the most dominant terms in the heat budget. Although the entrainment heat flux was small over short timescales, it may be important in long-term budgets because the long-term net surface heating could also be small.},

Measurements included radar estimates of rainfall, upper-ocean temperature (T), salinity (S), horizontal velocity, and microstructure. In situ observations of the fresh lens were made 5 to 7 hours after its formation. In the 5 hours after formation, the lens deepened to a depth of 40 m as indicated by its salinity anomaly.

The T-S relation exhibited curvature, which can be explained by surface cooling and upper-ocean mixing subsequent to formation of the lens. The lens exhibited a horizontal velocity anomaly in the direction of wind, which extended down to a depth of 40 m. The horizontal velocity anomaly is consistent with momentum being trapped near the surface due to rain-induced stratification. Vertical velocity, estimated from the divergence of zonal velocity, showed downwelling at the leading edge of the lens and upwelling at the trailing edge. The magnitude of vertical velocity at a depth of 20 m is 20 m day-1. Richardson numbers within the lens were low (0.25 to 0.5), suggesting that turbulent mixing was governed by critical-Ri instability. Wavenumber spectra of T and S in the upper 20 m exhibit a 5/3 range, which extends to wavenumbers below the range of local isotropy. Spectral levels were used to estimate turbulent dissipation rates of T and S, which were in turn used to estimate turbulent fluxes of heat and salt. Turbulent fluxes were also estimated from microstructure observations between depths of 10 and 60 m. Fluxes within the fresh lens were nearly uniform from 2 m to 35 m depth, then decreased to near zero at 45 m. The lifetime of fresh lenses during westerly wind bursts appears to be less than one day.

Richardson numbers within the lens were low (0.25 to 0.5), suggesting that turbulent mixing was governed by critical-Ri instability. Wavenumber spectra of T and S in the upper 20 m exhibit a 5/3 range, which extends to wavenumbers below the range of local isotropy. Spectral levels were used to estimate turbulent dissipation rates of T and S, which were in turn used to estimate turbulent fluxes of heat and salt. Turbulent fluxes were also estimated from microstructure observations between depths of 10 and 60 m. Fluxes within the fresh lens were nearly uniform from 2 m to 35 m depth, then decreased to near zero at 45 m. The lifetime of fresh lenses during westerly wind bursts appears to be less than one day.},

  abstract = {The evolution of a rain-produced, fresh surface anomaly observed in the western equatorial Pacific warm pool was modeled by use of the Princeton Ocean Model with Mellor-Yamada turbulent closure. The simulation was forced by a wind stress of 0.12 N m$-$2 and surface cooling of 225 W m$-$2. Following spin-up, 34-mm average rainfall was applied over a small portion of the domain. When rainfall ceased, momentum was trapped in a 1-m, fresh surface layer, and turbulent mixing was inhibited below the layer. Seven hours later, the surface density anomaly was reduced by an order of magnitude, and the surface velocity anomaly in the direction of the wind was 0.15 m s$-$1. The simulations show upwelling at the upwind edge of the anomaly and downwelling at the downwind edge with maxima of 15 and 35 m d$-$1, respectively. The momentum balance for the velocity component in the direction of the wind indicated that local acceleration, horizontal advection, and vertical diffusion were in approximate balance except at the downwind edge of the anomaly, where pressure gradient terms were also important. The budget of turbulent kinetic energy showed that shear production plus buoyancy production (or destruction) was approximately balanced by dissipation in much of the anomaly; advection and vertical turbulent transport terms were significant at some depths at the edges. The strength of the surface density front at the downwind edge of the anomaly tended to increase with time relative to the front at the upwind edge.},

The objective is to take advantage of the well-known numerical properties of methods based on expansions in terms of trigonometric functions in applications for which inhomogeneous boundary conditions and/or irregular domains are desired. The underlying mathematical idea is the exchange of inhomogeneity from boundary conditions to forcing terms. The fundamental techniques for handling inhomogeneity in boundary conditions, symmetry mismatches between body forces and dependent variables at boundaries and the imposition of boundary conditions on internal or immersed boundaries are described and illustrated using simple idealized examples. These techniques are then combined to illustrate how these methods can be applied to several examples of flows from laboratory experiments.},

The concept of gravitational available potential energy is used to formulate an energy budget in which the evolution of the background potential energy, i.e. the minimum potential energy attainable through adiabatic motions, can be explicitly examined. For closed systems, the background potential energy can change only due to diabatic processes. The rate of change of background potential energy is proportional to the molecular diffusivity. Changes in the background potential energy provide a direct measure of the potential energy changes due to irreversible diapycnal mixing. For open systems, background potential energy can also change due to boundary fluxes, which can be explicitly measured. The analysis is particularly appropriate for evaluation of diabatic mixing rates in numerical simulations of turbulent flows. The energetics of a shear driven mixing layer is used to illustrate the analysis.},

  abstract = {The oceanic sink of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important part of the global carbon budget. Understanding uncertainties in the calculation of this net flux into the ocean is crucial for climate research. One of the sources of the uncertainty within this calculation is the parameterization chosen for the CO2 gas-transfer velocity. We used a recently developed software toolbox, called the FluxEngine (Shutler et al., 2016), to estimate the monthly air-sea CO2 fluxes for the extratropical North Atlantic Ocean, including the European Arctic, and for the global ocean using several published quadratic and cubic wind speed parameterizations of the gas-transfer velocity. The aim of the study is to constrain the uncertainty caused by the choice of parameterization in the North Atlantic Ocean. This region is a large oceanic sink of CO2, and it is also a region characterized by strong winds, especially in winter but with good in situ data coverage. We show that the uncertainty in the parameterization is smaller in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic than in the global ocean. It is as little as 5 in the North Atlantic and 4 in the European Arctic, in comparison to 9 for the global ocean when restricted to parameterizations with quadratic wind dependence. This uncertainty becomes 46, 44, and 65%, respectively, when all parameterizations are considered. We suggest that this smaller uncertainty (5 and 4) is caused by a combination of higher than global average wind speeds in the North Atlantic (>7ms1) and lack of any seasonal changes in the direction of the flux direction within most of the region. We also compare the impact of using two different in situ pCO2 data sets (Takahashi et al. (2009) and Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) v1.5 and v2.0, for the flux calculation. The annual fluxes using the two data sets differ by 8% in the North Atlantic and 19% in the European Arctic. The seasonal fluxes in the Arctic computed from the two data sets disagree with each other possibly due to insufficient spatial and temporal data coverage, especially in winter.},

  abstract  = {The Mirai Indian Ocean cruise for the Study of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO)-convection Onset (MISMO) was a field experiment that took place in the central equatorial Indian Ocean during October-December 2006, using the research vessel Mirai, a moored buoy array, and land-based sites at the Maldive Islands. The aim of MISMO was to capture atmospheric and oceanic features in the equatorial Indian Ocean when convection in the MJO was initiated. This article describes details of the experiment as well as some selected early results. Intensive observations using Doppler radar, radiosonde, surface meteorological measurements, and other instruments were conducted at 0$\deg$, 80.5$\deg$E, after deploying an array of surface and subsurface moorings around this site. The Mirai stayed within this buoy array area from 24 October through 25 November. After a period of stationary observations, underway meteorological measurements were continued from the Maldives to the eastern Indian Ocean in early December. All observations were collected during an El Ni{\~{n}}o and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) event, which tended to suppress convection in the western Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean in throughout much of November 2006. However, as the IOD began to wane in mid-November, an abrupt change from westerly to easterly took place in upper tropospheric winds in the MISMO study region. By late November and early December, deep convection developed over the central Indian Ocean and eastward movement of large-scale cloud systems were observed. This article describes these variations in detail and how they advance our understanding of the onset of tropical deep convection on intraseasonal time scales.},

  abstract = { Abstract This study investigated the accuracy and physical representation of air-sea surface heat flux estimates for the Indian Ocean on annual, seasonal, and interannual time scales. Six heat flux products were analyzed, including the newly developed latent and sensible heat fluxes from the Objectively Analyzed Air-Sea Heat Fluxes (OAFlux) project and net shortwave and longwave radiation results from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), the heat flux analysis from the Southampton Oceanography Centre (SOC), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis 1 (NCEP1) and reanalysis-2 (NCEP2) datasets, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts operational (ECMWF-OP) and 40-yr Re-Analysis (ERA-40) products. This paper presents the analysis of the six products in depicting the mean, the seasonal cycle, and the interannual variability of the net heat flux into the ocean. Two time series of in situ flux measurements, one taken from a 1-yr Arabian Sea Experiment field program and the other from a 1-month Joint Air-Sea Monsoon Interaction Experiment (JASMINE) field program in the Bay of Bengal were used to evaluate the statistical properties of the flux products over the measurement periods. The consistency between the six products on seasonal and interannual time scales was investigated using a standard deviation analysis and a physically based correlation analysis. The study has three findings. First of all, large differences exist in the mean value of the six heat flux products. Part of the differences may be attributable to the bias in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models that underestimates the net heat flux into the Indian Ocean. Along the JASMINE ship tracks, the four NWP modeled mean fluxes all have a sign opposite to the observations, with NCEP1 being underestimated by 53 W m-2 (the least biased) and ECMWF-OP by 108 W m-2 (the most biased). At the Arabian Sea buoy site, the NWP mean fluxes also have an underestimation bias, with the smallest bias of 26 W m-2 (ERA-40) and the largest bias of 69 W m-2 (NCEP1). On the other hand, the OAFlux+ISCCP has the best comparison at both measurement sites. Second, the bias effect changes with the time scale. Despite the fact that the mean is biased significantly, there is no major bias in the seasonal cycle of all the products except for ECMWF-OP. The latter does not have a fixed mean due to the frequent updates of the model platform. Finally, among the four products (OAFlux+ISCCP, ERA-40, NCEP1, and NCEP2) that can be used for studying interannual variability, OAFlux+ISCCP and ERA-40 Qnet have good consistency as judged from both statistical and physical measures. NCEP1 shows broad agreement with the two products, with varying details. By comparison, NCEP2 is the least representative of the Qnet variabilities over the basin scale. },

  abstract = { Abstract A 25-yr (1981-2005) time series of daily latent and sensible heat fluxes over the global ice-free oceans has been produced by synthesizing surface meteorology obtained from satellite remote sensing and atmospheric model reanalyses outputs. The project, named Objectively Analyzed Air-Sea Fluxes (OAFlux), was developed from an initial study of the Atlantic Ocean that demonstrated that such data synthesis improves daily flux estimates over the basin scale. This paper introduces the 25-yr heat flux analysis and documents variability of the global ocean heat flux fields on seasonal, interannual, decadal, and longer time scales suggested by the new dataset. The study showed that, among all the climate signals investigated, the most striking is a long-term increase in latent heat flux that dominates the data record. The globally averaged latent heat flux increased by roughly 9 W m-2 between the low in 1981 and the peak in 2002, which amounted to about a 10\% increase in the mean value over the 25-yr period. Positive linear trends appeared on a global scale, and were most significant over the tropical Indian and western Pacific warm pool and the boundary current regions. The increase in latent heat flux was in concert with the rise of sea surface temperature, suggesting a response of the atmosphere to oceanic forcing. },

  abstract  = {Five to nine years of observations from the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean array in the tropical Pacific are used to document the seasonal cycle of surface winds, zonal currents, SST, thermocline depth, and dynamic height. Along the equator, the normally westward surface zonal current reverses direction in late boreal spring and early summer. This seasonal variation in the zonal surface current propagates westward, as do seasonal variations in the Equatorial Undercurrent and zonal surface winds at the equator. At 5$\deg$N and 5$\deg$S, the seasonal variations in the 20$\deg$C isotherm and dynamic height also propagate westward. Conversely at the equator in the eastern and central Pacific, the variations in 20$\deg$C isotherm depth and dynamic height propagate eastward. These seasonal variations are interpreted by means of a simple dynamical model based on linear equatorial wave theory. Model results indicate that seasonal variability between 5$\deg$N and 5$\deg$S is dominated by wind-forced equatorial Kelvin waves and first meridional mode Rossby waves of the first and second baroclinic modes. The sum of the Rossby waves and Kelvin waves results in westward propagation in the equatorial zonal currents and off-equatorial thermal structure and, yet, eastward propagation in thermocline depth and dynamic height along the equator in the eastern and central Pacific.},

  abstract  = {Using a dynamically motivated analysis of observations, and an intermediate-level coupled model, the interannual variability within the equatorial Atlantic is studied. It is found that a significant part of the observed variability can be described by an equatorial coupled mode akin to ENSO (El Ni{\~{n}}o?Southern Oscillation). The Atlantic mode signature is even more tightly focused on the equator and is situated proportionally farther to the west within the basin than its Pacific counterpart. Model simulations capture the equatorial coupled mode in relatively pure form and, for what are thought to be the most realistic parameter choices, show interannual oscillations favoring a 4-year period, which are not self-sustaining. The simulated spatial patterns agree well with those extracted from observations, including those features that distinguish the Atlantic from the Pacific. Sensitivity experiments show that the Atlantic coupled-mode signal is less robust than the corresponding Pacific ENSO signal but is still well-defined qualitatively, within reasonable parameter ranges. The results demonstrate that the primary mechanisms of oscillation for the Atlantic and Pacific are the same but that differences in the zonal structure and strength of air?sea coupling and mean ocean stratification offset the large differences in basin size, allowing similar oscillation periods for the two basin modes. An explanation for the distinct spatial patterns of simulated Atlantic and Pacific anomalies is found in the differences in climatological mean fields and ocean basin configurations. Together, the observational and model results present a picture of equatorial Atlantic variability in which coupled equatorial dynamics play an important but not exclusive role. It appears that the coupling is sufficiently strong to leave its imprint on the total variability but too weak to dictate it entirely, even at the equator.},

  abstract  = {Tropical and extratropical interactions on the intraseasonal time scale are studied in the context of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the Madden?Julian oscillation (MJO). To simplify the discussion, a high (low) MJO phase is defined as strong (suppressed) convective activity over the Indian Ocean. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter season, a high (low) AO phase is found more likely coupled with a high (low) MJO phase. Based on the regressed patterns and composites of various dynamical fields and quantities, possible mechanisms linking the AO and the MJO are examined. The analysis indicates that the MJO influence on extratropical circulations seems more evident than the AO influence on tropical circulations. The MJO interacts with the AO through meridional dispersion of Rossby waves in the Pacific sector. The geopotential height anomaly center over the North Pacific associated with the MJO can either reinforce or offset the AO Pacific action center. As a result, the AO pattern can be greatly affected by the MJO. When the AO and the MJO are in the same (opposite) phase, the Pacific action center becomes much stronger (weaker) than the Atlantic action center. The eddy momentum transports associated with the MJO in the Pacific sector are closely related to the retraction and extension of tropical Pacific easterlies and the subtropical Asian?Pacific jet. Because of its large scale, this regional effect is also reflected in the zonal mean state of wave transport and wave forcing on zonal wind, which in turn affects the phase of the AO.},

  abstract = {At the beginning of 2009 new space-borne observations of dry-air column-averaged mole fractions of atmospheric methane (XCH4) became available from the Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observations-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) instrument on board the Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). Until April 2012 concurrent {methane (CH4) retrievals} were provided by the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY) instrument on board the ENVironmental SATellite (ENVISAT). The GOSAT and SCIAMACHY XCH4 retrievals can be compared during the period of overlap. We estimate monthly average CH4 emissions between January 2010 and December 2011, using the TM5-4DVAR inverse modelling system. In addition to satellite data, high-accuracy measurements from the Cooperative Air Sampling Network of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA ESRL) are used, providing strong constraints on the remote surface atmosphere. We discuss five inversion scenarios that make use of different GOSAT and SCIAMACHY XCH4 retrieval products, including two sets of GOSAT proxy retrievals processed independently by the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON)/Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and the University of Leicester (UL), and the RemoTeC "Full-Physics" (FP) XCH4 retrievals available from SRON/KIT. The GOSAT-based inversions show significant reductions in the root mean square (rms) difference between retrieved and modelled XCH4, and require much smaller bias corrections compared to the inversion using SCIAMACHY retrievals, reflecting the higher precision and relative accuracy of the GOSAT XCH4. Despite the large differences between the GOSAT and SCIAMACHY retrievals, 2-year average emission maps show overall good agreement among all satellite-based inversions, with consistent flux adjustment patterns, particularly across equatorial Africa and North America. Over North America, the satellite inversions result in a significant redistribution of CH4 emissions from North-East to South-Central United States. This result is consistent with recent independent studies suggesting a systematic underestimation of CH4 emissions from North American fossil fuel sources in bottom-up inventories, likely related to natural gas production facilities. Furthermore, all four satellite inversions yield lower CH4 fluxes across the Congo basin compared to the NOAA-only scenario, but higher emissions across tropical East Africa. The GOSAT and SCIAMACHY inversions show similar performance when validated against independent shipboard and aircraft observations, and XCH4 retrievals available from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON).},

  abstract = {For four months in the fall and earlywinter of 1992, as Ice Station Weddell (ISW) driftednorthward through the ice-covered western Weddell Sea,ice station personnel profiled the atmosphericboundary layer (ABL) with radiosondes. These showedthat the ABL was virtually always stably stratifiedduring this season: 96{\%} of the soundings found anear-surface inversion layer. Forty-four percent ofthese inversions were surface-based. Eighty percentof the soundings that yielded unambiguous windprofiles showed an atmospheric jet with speeds as highas 14 m s-1 in a core below an altitude of 425 m. This paper documents the features of these inversionsand low-level jets. Because the inversion statistics,in particular, are like those reported in and aroundthe Arctic Ocean, similar local processes seem tocontrol the ABL over sea ice regions in bothhemispheres. A simple two-layer model, in which anelevated layer becomes frictionally decoupled from thesurface, does well in explaining the ISW jetstatistics. This model also implies a new geostrophicdrag parameterization for sea-ice regions that dependson the magnitude of the geostrophic wind, the 10-mdrag coefficient CDN10, and the ABL height, butnot explicitly on any stratification parameter.},

  abstract  = {We present an analysis framework and illustrate its potential to constrain terrestrial carbon fluxes at the regional scale using observations of CO2 and CO over North America acquired during the CO2 Budget and Rectification Airborne (COBRA) study in 2000. The COBRA data set, presented in detail in a companion paper [Gerbig et al., 2003] provides dense spatial coverage and extensive profiling in the lower atmosphere, revealing strong CO2 signatures of land surface fluxes in the active and relic mixed layers of the atmosphere. We introduce a receptor-oriented analysis framework designed to quantitatively interpret the atmospheric signatures of surface processes by linking concentrations at measurement locations (receptors) to surface fluxes in upwind regions. The framework incorporates three main components: (1) the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, driven with assimilated winds and running backward in time to map out the source-receptor relationship (footprint) at high temporal and spatial resolution; (2) an observation-based lateral boundary condition for CO2, resolving vertical and meridional gradients; and (3) a simple parameterization for biosphere-atmosphere fluxes that uses eddy covariance observations from the AmeriFlux network as prior estimates for fluxes. This framework allows quantitative comparison between the top-down constraint on fluxes from airborne observations of CO2 with the bottom-up constraint of eddy flux measurements in a Bayesian synthesis inversion. The model is used to investigate the observed representation error (mismatch between point measurements and grid-cell-averaged values in models), evaluated in the companion paper, showing that unresolved spatial variability of surface fluxes gives rise to most of the representation error over the continent. Thus the representation error reflects the effect of aggregation errors. Discrepancies between simulated and observed CO2 distributions are assessed to indicate where improvements are needed, including improved empirical representation of biosphere-atmosphere exchange process and better simulation of convective processes in atmospheric transport models.},

  abstract = {The goals of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Program's First Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE 1) are to determine and understand the properties and controlling factors of the aerosol in the remote marine atmosphere that are relevant to radiative forcing and climate. A key question in terms of this goal and the overall biogeochemical sulfur cycle is what factors control the formation, growth, and evolution of particles in the marine boundary layer (MBL). To address this question, simultaneous measurements of dimethylsulfide (DMS), sulfur dioxide (SO2), the aerosol chemical mass size distribution, and the aerosol number size distribution from 5 to 10,000 nm diameter were made on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ship Discoverer. From these data we conclude that the background MBL aerosol during ACE 1 often was composed of four distinct modes: an ultrafine (UF) mode (Dp = 20 nm), an Aitken mode (Dp = 80 nm), an accumulation mode (Dp = 300 nm), and a coarse mode (Dp > 300 nm). The presence of UF mode particles in the MBL could be explained by convective mixing between the free troposphere (FT) and the MBL associated with cloud pumping and subsidence following cold frontal passages. There was no evidence of major new particle production in the MBL. Oceanic emissions of DMS appeared to contribute to the growth of Aitken and accumulation mode particles. Coarse mode particles were comprised primarily of sea salt. Although these particles result from turbulence at the air-sea interface, the instantaneous wind speed accounted for only one third of the variance in the coarse mode number concentration in this region.},

  abstract  = {The Critical Depth Hypothesis formalized by Sverdrup in 1953 posits that vernal phytoplankton blooms occur when surface mixing shoals to a depth shallower than a critical depth horizon defining the point where phytoplankton growth exceeds losses. This hypothesis has since served as a cornerstone in plankton ecology and reflects the very common assumption that blooms are caused by enhanced growth rates in response to improved light, temperature, and stratification conditions, not simply correlated with them. Here, a nine-year satellite record of phytoplankton biomass in the subarctic Atlantic is used to reevaluate seasonal plankton dynamics. Results show that (1) bloom initiation occurs in the winter when mixed layer depths are maximum, not in the spring, (2) coupling between phytoplankton growth () and losses increases during spring stratification, rather than decreases, (3) maxima in net population growth rates (r) are as likely to occur in midwinter as in spring, and (4) r is generally inversely related to . These results are incompatible with the Critical Depth Hypothesis as a functional framework for understanding bloom dynamics. In its place, a Dilution Recoupling Hypothesisis described that focuses on the balance between phytoplankton growth and grazing, and the seasonally varying physical processes influencing this balance. This revised view derives from fundamental concepts applied during field dilution experiments, builds upon earlier modeling results, and is compatible with observed phytoplankton blooms in the absence of spring mixed layer shoaling.},

The objective of the flight was the investigation of the impact of clouds on the formation and destruction of aerosol in the boundary layer. The principle focus of this paper is an examination of the thermodynamic structure and a quantification of the entrainment rate. Three methods are presented. The first method uses the thermodynamic budget of the boundary layer to calculate its evolution over time. The second uses turbulence flux observations near the inversion, while the third uses estimates of the subsidence rate together with direct observations of the rate of change of cloud top height. All three methods suffer from serious errors. Our best estimate for the entrainment rate is 4 mm s-1 with an uncertainty of at least 50%. Based on an analysis of the boundary layer evolution in a mixing diagram, entrainment rates larger than about 8 mm s-1 can probably excluded because these larger entrainment rates would impose an unrealistic thinning of the cloud layer. Similarly, entrainment rates smaller than 2 mm s-1 can be excluded as well on the basis that this would impose unrealistic thickening of the cloud layer. The boundary layer is mostly buoyancy-driven, with shear-generated turbulence at most only half of the buoyancy-generated turbulence.},

  abstract  = {A survey is presented of microphysical properties of boundary layer clouds sampled over the Southern Ocean during the First Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE 1, November-December 1995). Observations were confined between the latitudes of 40S and 55S and between the longitudes of 135E and 160E, which covers a region south of the island of Tasmania. Because of the remoteness of the region that was sampled, the microphysical cloud structure represents background conditions in which anthropogenic influences are minimal. Maximum cloud droplet concentrations for individual case studies ranged between 45 and 200 cm3. These numbers are consistent with those reported from the summer phase of the Southern Ocean Cloud Experiment (SOCEX II, February 1995) and confirm that the droplet concentrations in an unpolluted atmosphere are largely constrained to values below 200 cm3. The often observed weak decoupling of the cloud layer from the surface layer suggests that the entrainment of aerosol from the free atmosphere cannot be ruled out as a significant source of cloud condensation nuclei. The effective radius of the cloud droplets ranged from 4.5 to 16.6m. On many occasions the condition for cloud top entrainment instability was satisfied. This implies the occurrence of dry conditions aloft, turbulence generation due to entrainment, and more generally, conditions of broken cloud cover. It is premature to suggest that these conditions are prevalent over the Southern Ocean as the experiment may have inadvertently targeted atmospheric conditions with regions of broken clouds.},

  abstract  = {Polar regions have great sensitivity to climate forcing; however, understanding of the physical processes coupling the atmosphere and ocean in these regions is relatively poor. Improving our knowledge of high-latitude surface fluxes will require close collaboration among meteorologists, oceanographers, ice physicists, and climatologists, and between observationalists and modelers, as well as new combinations of in situ measurements and satellite remote sensing. This article describes the deficiencies in our current state of knowledge about air-sea surface fluxes in high latitudes, the sensitivity of various high-latitude processes to changes in surface fluxes, and the scientific requirements for surface fluxes at high latitudes. We inventory the reasons, both logistical and physical, why existing flux products do not meet these requirements. Capturing an annual cycle in fluxes requires that instruments function through long periods of cold polar darkness, often far from support services, in situations subject to icing and extreme wave conditions. Furthermore, frequent cloud cover at high latitudes restricts the availability of surface and atmospheric data from visible and infrared (IR) wavelength satellite sensors. Recommendations are made for improving high-latitude fluxes, including 1) acquiring more in situ observations, 2) developing improved satellite-flux-observing capabilities, 3) making observations and flux products more accessible, and 4) encouraging flux intercomparisons.},

  abstract  = {Subpolar Mode Waters (SPMW) in the eastern North Atlantic subpolar gyre are investigated with hydrographic and Lagrangian data (surface drifters and isopycnal floats). Historical hydrographic data show that SPMWs are surface water masses with nearly uniform properties, confined between the ocean surface and the permanent pycnocline. SPMWs represented by densities 27.3, 27.4, and 27.5 are present in the eastern subpolar gyre and are influenced by the topography and the regional circulation. Construction of an absolute surface stream function from surface drifters shows that SPMWs are found along the mean path of each of the several branches of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) and their density increases gradually downstream. The Rockall Trough branch of the NAC carries 27.3, 27.4, and 27.5 SPMW toward the Iceland-Faroe Front. In the Iceland Basin, the Subarctic Front along the western flank of the Rockall Plateau carries a similar sequence of SPMW. The western side of the Central Iceland Basin branch of the NAC, on the other hand, veers westward and joins the East Reykjanes Ridge Current, feeding the 27.5 SPMW on the Reykjanes Ridge. The separation among the various NAC branches most likely explains the different properties that characterize the 27.5 SPMW found on the Reykjanes Ridge and on the Iceland-Faroe Ridge. Since the branches of the NAC have a dominant northeastward direction, the newly observed distribution of SPMW combined with the new stream function calculation modify the original hypothesis of McCartney and Talley (1982) of a smooth cyclonic pathway for SPMW advection and density increase around the subpolar gyre.},

Air-sea flux data from the National Oceanography Center, Southampton (NOCS), and hydrographic data from the A24 cruise collected during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) are used to estimate the contribution of diapycnal and isopycnal fluxes to the density classes that include SPMW. Surface diapycnal volume flux is the dominant source of waters in the SPMW density. In the North Atlantic subpolar gyre the diapycnal volume flux occurs along the main branches of the North Atlantic Current (NAC) and it has an average transport of 14{$\pm$}6.5 Sv, with a maximum of 21.5 Sv across the 27.35 isopycnal. The regional distribution of the diapycnal flux on isopycnal surfaces is computed to identify the areas with the largest diapycnal flux. These regions coincide with the location of SPMW based on potential vorticity. The surface diapycnal flux is associated with obduction and subduction through the permanent pycnocline. Therefore, the water involved in the transformation of SPMWs is continuously exchanged with the ocean interior. In addition, we suggest that subduction is not associated with smooth advection from the mixed layer to the ocean interior, but is water mass loss entrainment into the deep overflows of the subpolar gyre. The isopycnal component of the SPMW throughput is estimated from the geostrophic transport across the A24 section from Greenland to Scotland and is 10{\%} to 40{\%} of the diapycnal flux.},

As part of the First Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE 1, November 15 to December 15, 1995), the total light scattering and backscattering coefficients by particles (sp and bsp) were measured at Cape Grim, Tasmania. Such measurements were made to characterize aerosol radiative forcing relevant to climate change at a southern hemisphere site. A controlled relative humidity (RH) nephelometry system (humidograph) was used to measure the dependence of sp and bsp upon controlled RH, upper particle diameter (Dp), and wavelength of light (). Parameters derived from the measurements necessary to incorporate aerosols into climate models include the dependence of light scattering on aerosol hygroscopic growth ((RH)) and the hemispheric backscatter fraction (b), both as functions of wavelength of light. Differences in parameter values during clean marine and non-clean-marine time periods were greatest for sp and bsp for Dp1m and were least for (RH) and b. During clean marine conditions, for Dp10m, and at 550 nm, means and standard deviations of key parameters measured included (RH equal to 82%) = 1.98 0.08 for sp, (RH equal to 82%) = 1.48 0.09 for bsp, b = 0.16 0.01 at RH equal to 22%, and b = 0.12 0.03 at RH equal to 82%. These measurements contribute to characterizing aerosol optical properties at a remote marine site, serve as a basis of comparison to polluted sites, and may provide input to climate models.},

  abstract  = {A modified version of the extended multiple linear regression (eMLR) method is used to estimate anthropogenic carbon concentration (Canth) changes along the Pacific P02 and P16 hydrographic sections over the past two decades. P02 is a zonal section crossing the North Pacific at 30N, and P16 is a meridional section crossing the North and South Pacific at ~150W. The eMLR modifications allow the uncertainties associated with choices of regression parameters to be both resolved and reduced. Canth is found to have increased throughout the water column from the surface to ~1000m depth along both lines in both decades. Mean column Canth inventory increased consistently during the earlier (1990s-2000s) and recent (2000s-2010s) decades along P02, at rates of 0.53{$\pm$}0.11 and 0.46{$\pm$}0.11 mol m-2, respectively. By contrast, Canth storage accelerated from 0.29{$\pm$}0.10 to 0.45{$\pm$}0.11 mol m 1 along P16. Shifts in water mass distributions are ruled out as a potential cause of this increase, which is instead attributed to recent increases in the ventilation of the South Pacific Subtropical Cell. Decadal changes along P16 are extrapolated across the gyre to estimate a Pacific Basin average storage between 60S and 60N of 6.1{$\pm$}1.5 PgC decade-1 in the earlier decade and 8.8{$\pm$}2.2 PgC decade-1 in the recent decade. This storage estimate is large despite the shallow Pacific Canth penetration due to the large volume of the Pacific Ocean. By 2014, Canth storage had changed Pacific surface seawater pH by 0.08 to 0.14 and aragonite saturation state by 0.57 to 0.82.},

As in prior studies, the wind-driven flow was separated from the total flow by subtraction of a deep reference current. The wind-driven flow was shown to be in an Ekman balance on daily timescales over a period of several months. The mean observed transport was to the right of the wind and agreed to within 3% in magnitude and 4 in phase with the predicted Ekman transport, although the error bar was about 20%. The mean velocity profile was a smooth spiral, qualitatively similar (although flatter) than the theoretical Ekman spiral. Prom the observed mean momentum balance, profiles of the turbulent stress and eddy viscosity were inferred. Eddy viscosity estimates within the wind mixed layer were O(100 cm2 s-1).},

  abstract  = {The critical-depth model for the onset of the spring phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic has recently been called into question by several researchers. The critical-depth model considers that the spring bloom starts when the mixed layer shoals to become shallower than a critical depth. Satellite and in situ measurements of chlorophyll are used here to show that the critical-depth model is indeed flawed. It is shown that the critical-depth model does not apply in the spring because the basic assumption of an upper layer that is well-mixed in plankton is not met. Instead, the spring bloom forms in shallow near-surface layers that deepen with the onset of thermal stratification. A stratification-onset model for the annual cycle in plankton is proposed that adheres to the conventional idea that the spring bloom represents a change from a deep-mixed regime to a shallow light-driven regime, but where the upper layers are not well mixed in plankton in spring and so the critical-depth model does not apply. Ironically, perhaps, the critical-depth model applies in the autumn and winter when plankton are well-mixed to the seasonal thermocline, so that the critical-depth model can be used to determine whether net winter production is positive or negative.},

Uncertainties in their life cycles and radiative properties make them interesting from a weather and climate perspective. Data from the standard cloud physics payload during the High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) Pole-to-Pole Observations global transects provide a unique snapshot the nature of low-level clouds in the Southern Ocean. High quantities of supercooled liquid water (up to 0.47gm-3) were observed in clouds as cold as 22C during two flights in different seasons and different meteorological conditions, supporting climatologies inferred from satellite observations. Cloud droplet concentrations were calculated from mean droplet size and liquid water concentrations, and were in the range of 30-120cm-3, which is fairly typical for the pristine Southern Ocean environment. Ice in nonprecipitating or lightly precipitating clouds was found to be rare, while drizzle drops with diameter greater than 100m formed through warm rain processes were widespread. Large, pristine crystals were commonly seen in very low concentrations below cloud base.},

These can provide quantitative profiles of the optical properties of the water column to depths of 20 to 30??m in productive coastal waters and to depths of 100??m for a blue lidar in the open ocean. The properties that can be measured include beam attenuation, diffuse attenuation, absorption, volume scattering at the scattering angle of 180??deg, and total backscattering. Lidar can be used to infer the relative vertical distributions of fish, plankton, bubbles, and other scattering particles. Using scattering as a tracer, lidar can provide information on the dynamics of the upper ocean, including mixed-layer depth, internal waves, and turbulence. Information in the polarization of the lidar return has been critical to the success of many of these investigations. Future progress in the field is likely through a better understanding of the variability of the lidar ratio and the application of high-spectral-resolution lidar to the ocean. Somewhat farther into the future, capabilities are likely to include lidar profiling of temperature in the ocean and an oceanographic lidar in space.},

Number-size distributions N(Dp) from 3 to 800 nm diameter and the hygroscopic properties of the aerosol in the 30 to 300 nm diameter range (which contains most of the CCN active at 0.5%) were measured concurrently at the same location. This data set provides a basis to compare measured and modeled CCN concentrations. A critical particle diameter that would form cloud droplets at 0.5% supersaturation was derived from the hygroscopic growth data including consideration of the hydration of the size distribution measurement. This empirically derived diameter incorporates the effects of soluble and insoluble mass as well as an effective van't Hoff factor and surface tension as described by Khler theory for heterogeneous nucleation of cloud droplets. The size distributions were integrated for diameters greater than the critical value and compared to the directly measured CCN concentrations. The modeled CCN concentration was 95 cm-3 during baseline sector periods and 128 cm-3 overall. This was about 20% greater than the directly measured CCN concentration and well correlated (R2 = 0.7) with measured CCN. Two thirds of the CCN at 0.5% supersaturation derive from an accumulation mode (80 nm < Dp < 200 nm); with one sixth from each of the other two modes, a larger mode (Dp > 200 nm) and the Aitken mode (Dp < 80 nm). The data include air masses from continental, anthropogenic, and biomass burning sources as well as the more dominant marine source.},

Measurements of DMSP in sea ice were also made. During the summer months the Subtropical Convergence (STC) and Antarctic Convergence (AC) were identified as important source regions of these sulfur compounds. In the Seasonal Ice zone (SIZ) there were marked longitudinal differences possibly reflecting higher productivity and the extent of the sea ice in this region. Levels of DMSP in sea ice cores were consistent with this regional difference. High and variable concentrations of DMSP also occurred in the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ) (45-53S), decreasing to lower levels around 64S, close to the Antarctic Divergence (AD). Upwelling of deep water around the AD is suggested to have been responsible for the low biological activity and low DMSP levels. While there was generally a good relationship between DMSPp and biomass, there was a marked difference in the DMSPp:chlorophyll a ratio between regions, and between years. DMSP was generally negatively correlated with dissolved nitrate, however, it was unclear if the level of nitrate directly affected DMSP production. DMSw levels were highest in the mixed layer, with lower, yet detectable, levels in the deeper ocean. DMSw was occasionally elevated in Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), suggesting that ice shelf water transports this substance to deeper waters. DMSP was not found above detection limits below the mixed layer, but some evidence was found that DMSP may be transported to deeper waters, close to the Antarctic continent.},

Laboratory experiments aimed at studying certain key features of K-H billows are also discussed, wherein the billows were generated in a two-layer stratified tilt-tank. It is shown that small-scale turbulent mixing is present within billows from the early stages of their evolution, but mixing becomes intense and the billows are destroyed as they achieve a maximum height and initiate collapse at a non-dimensional time of Ut 5, where U is the velocity shear and is the wavelength. When TU< 5, the Thorpe scale LT and the maximum Thorpe displacement (LT)max, normalized by the local billow height Lb, are independent of both the horizontal location within the billow and time with LTL (0.49{$\pm$}0.03) and (LT)maxLb(0.89{$\pm$}0.02). After the collapse starts, however, the pertinent lengthscale ratios in the core of the billow show values similar to those of fully developed turbulent patches, i.e., LTLb(0.29{$\pm$}0.04) and (LT)maxLb(0.68{$\pm$}0.04).

MLD is determined from individual profiles using both potential density and potential temperature criteria, and a monthly climatology is derived from individual MLDs using an objective mapping method. Quantitative data are available in the auxiliary material. The spatial structures of MLDs are similar in each month, with deep mixed layers within and just north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The deepest mixed layers are found from June to October and are located just north of the ACC where Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) are formed. Examination of individual MLDs indicates that deep mixed layers (MLD 400 m) from both the density and temperature criteria are concentrated in a narrow surface density band which is within the density range of SAMW. The surface salinity for these deep mixed layers associated with the SAMW formation are slightly fresher compared to historical estimates. Differences in air-sea heat exchanges, wind stress, and wind stress curl in the Pacific and Indian oceans suggest that the mode water formation in each ocean basin may be preconditioned by different processes. Wind mixing and Ekman transport of cold water from the south may assist the SAMW formation in the Indian Ocean. In the eastern Pacific, the formation of mode water is potentially preconditioned by the relative strong cooling and weak stratification from upwelling.},

  abstract  = {During the period 1959-1973 the La Jolla Tritium Laboratory monitored bomb-produced tritium in surface seawater from 15 stations in the Pacific Ocean. Some 500 tritium determinations were carried out during this time. Furthermore, between 1965 and 1972 a series of subsurface samples from 49 locations in the Pacific Ocean was measured, and tritium concentrations as a function of depth were determined. The determinations had a standard error of 4% and an uncertainty in the zero value of about 0.17 tritium unit. The most significant oceanographic conclusions that must be drawn from these data can be summarized in the following way: (1) Lateral flow along contours of constant density is the major factor controlling the tritium distribution in the surface and subsurface waters of the Pacific Ocean. Input of tritium into the water below the mixed layer occurs between 45 and 30N and south of 60S. The sinking of water in the mid-Pacific at 30N and its flow toward the equator was previously recognized from the presence of a salinity maximum below the thermocline. Our tritium measurements allow us now to estimate the southward component of the rate of this flow to be 1.3{$\pm$}0.5 cm/s. In many other areas the tritium content of water under the mixed layer is undoubtedly also due to local sinking of surface water and subsequent lateral subsurface flow. (2) An upper limit for the coefficient of vertical eddy diffusion can be calculated from our tritium data in the eastern North Pacific gyre. This upper limit of 0.3 cm2/s is well below estimates derived by most other methods (Veronis, 1969), but it agrees well with the upper limit of 0.2 cm2/s derived by Rooth and stlund (1972) from tritium measurements in the Sargasso Sea. Thus it appears that transport across lines of constant density is much slower than previously assumed. (3) The mean lifetime of water in the mixed layer of the North Pacific Ocean, i.e., the residence time, varies greatly with geographical location. North of 10N the average residence time is between 9 and 15 years, depending on the assumed rate of the molecular exchange of water between atmosphere and ocean.},

  abstract  = {We present a general framework for designing and analyzing Lagrangian-type aircraft observations in order to measure surface fluxes of trace gases on regional scales. Lagrangian experiments minimize uncertainties due to advection by measuring tracer concentrations upstream and downstream of the study region, assuring that observed concentration changes represent fluxes within the region. The framework includes (1) a receptor-oriented model of atmospheric transport, including turbulent dispersion, (2) an upstream tracer boundary condition, (3) a surface flux model that predicts the distribution of tracer fluxes in time and space, and (4) a Bayesian inverse analysis that combines a priori information with observations to yield optimal estimates of tracer fluxes by the flux model. We use a receptor-oriented transport model, the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, to simulate ensembles of particles representing air parcels transported backward in time from an observation point (receptor), linking receptor concentrations with upstream locations and surface inputs. STILT provides the capability to forecast flight tracks for Lagrangian experiments in the presence of atmospheric shear and dispersion. STILT may be used to forecast flight tracks that sample the upstream tracer boundary condition, or to analyze the data and provide optimized parameters in the surface flux model. We present a case study of regional scale surface CO2 fluxes using data over the United States obtained in August 2000 in the CO2 Budget and Rectification Airborne (COBRA-2000) study. STILT forecasts were obtained using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Eta model to plan the flight tracks. Results from the Bayesian inversion showed large reductions in a priori errors for estimates of daytime ecosystem uptake of CO2, but constraints on nighttime respiration fluxes were weaker, due to few observations of CO2 in the nocturnal boundary layer. Derived CO2 fluxes from the influence-following analysis differed notably from estimates using a conventional one-dimensional budget (Boundary Layer Budget) on a typical day, due to time-variable contributions from forests and croplands. A critical examination of uncertainties in the Lagrangian analyses revealed that the largest uncertainties were associated with errors in forecasting the upstream sampling locations and with aggregation of heterogeneous fluxes at the surface. Suggestions for improvements in future experiments are presented.},

  abstract  = {We derive regional-scale (104 km2) CO2 flux estimates for summer 2004 in the northeast United States and southern Quebec by assimilating extensive data into a receptor-oriented model-data fusion framework. Surface fluxes are specified using the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM), a simple, readily optimized biosphere model driven by satellite data, AmeriFlux eddy covariance measurements and meteorological fields. The surface flux model is coupled to a Lagrangian atmospheric adjoint model, the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport Model (STILT) that links point observations to upwind sources with high spatiotemporal resolution. Analysis of CO2 concentration data from the NOAA-ESRL tall tower at Argyle, ME and from extensive aircraft surveys, shows that the STILT VPRM framework successfully links model flux fields to regionally representative atmospheric CO2 data, providing a bridge between bottom-up and top-down methods for estimating regional CO2 budgets on timescales from hourly to monthly. The surface flux model, with initial calibration to eddy covariance data, produces an excellent a priori condition for inversion studies constrained by atmospheric concentration data. Exploratory optimization studies show that data from several sites in a region are needed to constrain model parameters for all major vegetation types, because the atmosphere commingles the influence of regional vegetation types, and even high-resolution meteorological analysis cannot disentangle the associated contributions. Airborne data are critical to help define uncertainty within the optimization framework, showing for example, that in summertime CO2 concentration at Argyle (107 m) is 0.6 ppm lower than the mean in the planetary boundary layer.},

  abstract  = {Knowledge of trace gas fluxes at the land surface is essential for understanding the impact of human activities on the composition and radiative balance of the atmosphere. An ability to derive fluxes at the regional scale (on the order of 10{$^2$}-10{$^$}4 km{$^2$}), at the scale of ecosystems and political borders, is crucial for policy and management responses. Lagrangian (air mass-following) aircraft experiments have potential for providing direct estimates of regional-scale fluxes by measuring concentration changes in air parcels as they travel over the landscape. Successful Lagrangian experiments depend critically on forecasts of air parcel locations, rate of dispersion of air parcels, and proper assessment of forecast errors. We describe an operational tool to forecast air parcel locations and dispersion and to guide planning of flights for air mass-following experiments using aircraft. The tool consists of a particle dispersion model driven by mesoscale model forecasts from operational centers. The particle model simulates time-reversed motions of air parcels from specified locations, predicting the source regions which influence these locations. Forecast errors are incorporated into planning of Lagrangian experiments using statistics of wind errors derived by comparison with radiosonde data, as well as the model-to-model spread in forecast results. We illustrate the tool's application in a project designed to infer regional CO2 fluxes the CO2 Budget and Rectification Airborne study, discuss errors in the forecasts, and outline future steps for further improvement of the tool.},

Additionally, forests in the Rocky Mountains have recently been severely damaged by drought, fire, and insect outbreaks, which have been quantified at local scales but not assessed in terms of carbon uptake at regional scales. The Airborne Carbon in the Mountains Experiment was carried out in 2007 partly to assess carbon uptake in western U.S. mountain ecosystems. The magnitude and seasonal change of carbon uptake were quantified by (1) paired upwind-downwind airborne CO2 observations applied in a boundary layer budget, (2) a spatially explicit ecosystem model constrained using remote sensing and flux tower observations, and (3) a downscaled global tracer transport inversion. Top-down approaches had mean carbon uptake equivalent to flux tower observations at a subalpine forest, while the ecosystem model showed less. The techniques disagreed on temporal evolution. Regional carbon uptake was greatest in the early summer immediately following snowmelt and tended to lessen as the region experienced dry summer conditions. This reduction was more pronounced in the airborne budget and inversion than in flux tower or upscaling, possibly related to lower snow water availability in forests sampled by the aircraft, which were lower in elevation than the tower site. Changes in vegetative greenness associated with insect outbreaks were detected using satellite reflectance observations, but impacts on regional carbon cycling were unclear, highlighting the need to better quantify this emerging disturbance effect on montane forest carbon cycling.},

  abstract  = {Wetlands comprise the single largest global source of atmospheric methane, but current flux estimates disagree in both magnitude and distribution at the continental scale. This study uses atmospheric methane observations over North America from 2007 to 2008 and a geostatistical inverse model to improve understanding of Canadian methane fluxes and associated biogeochemical models. The results bridge an existing gap between traditional top-down, inversion studies, which typically emphasize total emission budgets, and biogeochemical models, which usually emphasize environmental processes. The conclusions of this study are threefold. First, the most complete process-based methane models do not always describe available atmospheric methane observations better than simple models. In this study, a relatively simple model of wetland distribution, soil moisture, and soil temperature outperformed more complex model formulations. Second, we find that wetland methane fluxes have a broader spatial distribution across western Canada and into the northern U.S. than represented in existing flux models. Finally, we calculate total methane budgets for Canada and for the Hudson Bay Lowlands, a large wetland region (50-60N, 75-96W). Over these lowlands, we find total methane fluxes of 1.8{$\pm$}0.24 Tg C/yr, a number in the midrange of previous estimates. Our total Canadian methane budget of 16.0{$\pm$}1.2 Tg C/yr is larger than existing inventories, primarily due to high anthropogenic emissions in Alberta. However, methane observations are sparse in western Canada, and additional measurements over Alberta will constrain anthropogenic sources in that province with greater confidence.},

Results show that current inventories from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research underestimate methane emissions nationally by a factor of $\sim$1.5 and $\sim$1.7, respectively. Our study indicates that emissions due to ruminants and manure are up to twice the magnitude of existing inventories. In addition, the discrepancy in methane source estimates is particularly pronounced in the south-central United States, where we find total emissions are $\sim$2.7 times greater than in most inventories and account for 24 {$\pm$} 3% of national emissions. The spatial patterns of our emission fluxes and observed methane-propane correlations indicate that fossil fuel extraction and refining are major contributors (45 {$\pm$} 13%) in the south-central United States. This result suggests that regional methane emissions due to fossil fuel extraction and processing could be 4.9 {$\pm$} 2.6 times larger than in EDGAR, the most comprehensive global methane inventory. These results cast doubt on the US EPA's recent decision to downscale its estimate of national natural gas emissions by 25-30%. Overall, we conclude that methane emissions associated with both the animal husbandry and fossil fuel industries have larger greenhouse gas impacts than indicated by existing inventories.},

  abstract  = {The contemporary global carbon cycle is dominated by perturbations from anthropogenic CO2 emissions. One approach to identify, quantify, and monitor anthropogenic emissions is to focus on intensely emitting urban areas. In this study, we compare the ability of different CO2 observing systems to constrain anthropogenic flux estimates in the Los Angeles megacity. We consider different observing system configurations based on existing observations and realistic near-term extensions of the current ad hoc network. We use a high-resolution regional model (Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport-Weather Research and Forecasting) to simulate different observations and observational network designs within and downwind of the Los Angeles (LA) basin. A Bayesian inverse method is employed to quantify the relative ability of each network to improve constraints on flux estimates. Ground-based column CO2 observations provide useful complementary information to surface observations due to lower sensitivity to localized dynamics, but column CO2 observations from a single site do not appear to provide sensitivity to emissions from the entire LA megacity. Surface observations from remote, downwind sites contain weak, sporadic urban signals and are complicated by other source/sink impacts, limiting their usefulness for quantifying urban fluxes in LA. We find a network of eight optimally located in-city surface observation sites provides the minimum sampling required for accurate monitoring of CO2 emissions in LA, and present a recommended baseline network design. We estimate that this network can distinguish fluxes on 8 week time scales and 10 km spatial scales to within ~12 g C m2 d1 (~10% of average peak fossil CO2 flux in the LA domain).},

  abstract  = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important gas for climate and for stratospheric chemistry, with a lifetime exceeding 100 years. Global concentrations have increased steadily since the 18th century, apparently due to human-associated emissions, principally from the application of nitrogen fertilizers. However, quantitative studies of agricultural emissions at large spatial scales are lacking, inhibited by the difficulty of measuring small enhancements in atmospheric concentration. Here we derive regional emission rates for N2O in the agricultural heartland of California based on analysis of in-situ airborne atmospheric observations collected using a new quantum cascade laser spectrometer. The data were obtained on board the NOAA WP-3 research aircraft during the CalNex (California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change) program in late spring 2010. We coupled the WRF (weather research and forecasting) model, a meso-scale meteorology model, with the STILT (stochastic time-inverted Lagrangian transport) model, a Lagrangian particle dispersion model, to link our in-situ airborne observations to surface emissions. We then used a variety of statistical methods to identify source areas and to optimize emission rates. Our results are consistent with the view that fertilizer application is the largest source of N2O in the Central Valley. The spatial distribution of surface emissions, based on California land use and activity maps, was very different than indicated in the leading emission inventory (EDGAR 4.0). Our estimated total emission flux of N2O for California in May and June was 3-4 times larger than the annual mean given for the state by EDGAR and other inventories, indicating a strong seasonal variation. We estimated the statewide total annual emissions of N2O to be 0.042{$\pm$}0.011 Tg N/year, roughly equivalent to inventory values if we account for seasonal variations using observations obtained in the midwestern United States. This state total N2O emission is 20.5 Tg CO2 equivalent (100 year global warming potential 310 CO2 eq/g N2O), accounting for approximately 4% of the state total greenhouse gas emissions.},

Our results indicate peak N2O emissions in June with a strong seasonal cycle. The spatial distribution of sources closely mirrors data on fertilizer application with particularly large N2O sources over the US Cornbelt. Existing inventories for N2O predict emissions that differ substantially from the inverse model results in both seasonal cycle and magnitude. We estimate a total annual N2O budget over the central US of 0.9-1.2 TgN/yr and an extrapolated budget for the entire US and Canada of 2.1-2.6 TgN/yr. By this estimate, the US and Canada account for 12-15% of the total global N2O source or 32-39% of the global anthropogenic source as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007.},

  abstract  = {The TransCom 3 experiment was begun to explore the estimation of carbon sources and sinks via the inversion of simulated tracer transport. We build upon previous TransCom work by presenting the seasonal inverse results which provide estimates of carbon flux for 11 land and 11 ocean regions using 12 atmospheric transport models. The monthly fluxes represent the mean seasonal cycle for the 1992 to 1996 time period. The spread among the model results is larger than the average of their estimated flux uncertainty in the northern extratropics and vice versa in the tropical regions. In the northern land regions, the model spread is largest during the growing season. Compared to a seasonally balanced biosphere prior flux generated by the CASA model, we find significant changes to the carbon exchange in the European region with greater growing season net uptake which persists into the fall months. Both Boreal North America and Boreal Asia show lessened net uptake at the onset of the growing season with Boreal Asia also exhibiting greater peak growing season net uptake. Temperate Asia shows a dramatic springward shift in the peak timing of growing season net uptake relative to the neutral CASA flux while Temperate North America exhibits a broad flattening of the seasonal cycle. In most of the ocean regions, the inverse fluxes exhibit much greater seasonality than that implied by the pCO2 derived fluxes though this may be due, in part, to misallocation of adjacent land flux. In the Southern Ocean, the austral spring and fall exhibits much less carbon uptake than implied by pCO2 derived fluxes. Sensitivity testing indicates that the inverse estimates are not overly influenced by the prior flux choices. Considerable agreement exists between the model mean, annual mean results of this study and that of the previously published TransCom annual mean inversion. The differences that do exist are in poorly constrained regions and tend to exhibit compensatory fluxes in order to match the global mass constraint. The differences between the estimated fluxes and the prior model over the northern land regions could be due to the prior model respiration response to temperature. Significant phase differences, such as that in the Temperate Asia region, may be due to the limited observations for that region. Finally, differences in the boreal land regions between the prior model and the estimated fluxes may be a reflection of the timing of spring thaw and an imbalance in respiration versus photosynthesis.},

  abstract  = {Studies that have attempted to estimate sources and sinks of trace gases such as CO2 with inverse calculations unanimously identify the lack of continental stations as a prime obstacle. Continental stations have traditionally been avoided because of the difficulty of interpretation due to large time-variability of trace substance mixing ratios. Large variability is caused by the proximity to the strongly variable sources in space and time and the complicated airflow within the lowermost 100-200 m of the planetary boundary layer. To address the need for continental stations and to overcome the problems associated with them, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory started in 1992 to measure CO2 and other trace gases on tall television transmission towers [Bakwin et al., 1995]. An essential question in connection with these tower measurements is the area around the tower from which fluxes substantially contribute to the observed short-term variability of trace gas mixing ratios. We present here a simple data and back trajectory-based method to estimate the fraction of the observed short-term variability explained by a localized flux around a tall television transmission tower in Wisconsin in dependence of its location relative to the tower (the concentration footprint). We find that the timescale over which the imprint of surface fluxes on air parcels before its arrival at the tower are still discernible in the mixing ratio variations observed at the tower is of the order of 1.5 days. Based on this timescale and the characteristics of air parcel trajectories, we infer a spatial extent of the footprint of the order of 106 km2, or roughly a tenth of the area of the United States. This is encouraging evidence that tall tower measurements may be useful in global inversions and may also have implications for monitoring fluxes of anthropogenic trace substances on regional scales.},

  abstract  = {The inversion of atmospheric transport of CO2 may potentially be a means for monitoring compliance with emission treaties in the future. There are two types of errors, though, which may cause errors in inversions: (1) amplification of high-frequency data variability given the information loss in the atmosphere by mixing and (2) systematic errors in the CO2 flux estimates caused by various approximations used to formulate the inversions. In this study we use simulations with atmospheric transport models and a time independent inverse scheme to estimate these errors as a function of network size and the number of flux regions solved for. Our main results are as follows. (1) When solving for 10-20 source regions, the average uncertainty of flux estimates caused by amplification of high-frequency data variability alone decreases strongly with increasing number of stations for up to 150 randomly positioned stations and then levels off (for 150 stations of the order of 0.2 Pg C/yr). As a rule of thumb, about 10 observing stations are needed per region to be estimated. (2) of all the sources of systematic errors, modeling error is the largest. Our estimates of SF6 emissions from five continental regions simulated with 12 different AGCMs differ by up to a factor of 2. The number of observations needed to overcome the information loss due to atmospheric mixing is hence small enough to permit monitoring of fluxes with inversions on a continental scale in principle. Nevertheless errors in transport modeling are still too large for inversions to be a quantitatively reliable option for flux monitoring.},

  abstract  = {We analyze the spatial variability of CO2 measurements from aircraft platforms, including extensive observations acquired over North America during the CO2 Budget and Rectification Airborne (COBRA) study in 2000. The COBRA data set is unique in its dense spatial coverage and extensive profiling in the lower atmosphere. Strong signatures of CO2 fluxes at the land surface were observed in the active and relic mixed layers of the atmosphere (up to 20 ppm gradients). Free tropospheric CO2 exhibited significantly less variability except in areas affected by convective transport. Statistical analyses of the COBRA data indicate that CO2 mixed-layer averages can be determined from vertical profiles with an accuracy of approximately 0.2 ppm, limited by atmospheric variance. Analysis of the associated representation error suggests that models require horizontal resolution smaller than 30 km to fully resolve spatial variations of atmospheric CO2 in the boundary layer over the continent. To provide a global context for these data, we analyzed the GLOBALVIEW marine boundary layer (MBL) reference CO2. Comparison of the MBL reference with extensive aircraft data extending over 20 years, covering the whole troposphere over the northern Pacific, shows significant seasonal biases of up to 2 ppm in the free troposphere, indicating that the MBL reference is a suitable boundary condition only for some applications. The spatial variability of CO2 revealed by the COBRA-2000 calls for a suitable analysis framework to derive regional and continental fluxes, presented in a companion paper. The problem requires boundary conditions constrained by both surface and upper tropospheric observations and constraints on terrestrial fluxes that exploit the information content of the highly variable CO2 distribution over land.},

  abstract  = {This study examines the applicability of single-layer hydraulic theory to Alpine f{\:o}hn winds in the example of the flow in the Brenner Pass region (Austria/Italy). The south f{\:o}hn is described as the gap flow over the Pass and along the associated Wipp Valley. Numerical shallow-water simulations for a wide range of initial conditions, including shallow- and deep-f{\:o}hn cases, are discussed and compared with selected measurements collected within the Mesoscale Alpine Programme (MAP). The observational analyses are based on Doppler and aerosol-backscatter lidar data for a specific f{\:o}hn case, and on surface observations and radiosoundings for all f{\:o}hn cases observed within the 70-day MAP Special Observing Period (SOP).Radiosoundings at a location upstream (south) and downstream (north) of the Brenner Pass reveal that the average MAP SOP f{\:o}hn case had subcritical flow south and nearly critical flow north of the Brenner Pass. The hydraulic model indicates flow transition to a supercritical state near the Pass, a hydraulic jump 2 km further north, mainly subcritical flow in the upper Wipp Valley except near the Brenner and, especially for shallow f{\:o}hn, a tendency to becoming supercritical in the lower Wipp Valley. The model results suggest that the vertical topographic contraction exerts stronger control for the flow at the Brenner gap than the lateral contraction. In accordance with Doppler lidar measurements, the hydraulic model captures the decrease of the wind speed in the across-valley direction from east to west in the northern part of the valley. This asymmetric flow pattern is a result of the complex valley geometry rather than of the influence of upper-level synoptic winds, as suggested in a previous study.For some observed cases the strength of the temperature inversion at the top of the f{\:o}hn layer decreased across the Brenner Pass, presumably due to entrainment processes. Consequently, the reduced-gravity decreased as well. There are two major reasons for the only moderate agreement between the hydraulic parameters retrieved from soundings and those provided by the model: the model assumes a constant value of reduced-gravity, and the calculation of hydraulic parameters for f{\:o}hn cases without a strong and sharp temperature inversion is ambiguous. Essential flow patterns in the simulated fields, such as the location of the pressure minimum and wind speed maxima, compare well with the surface observations along a valley transect. Indications for a steeply amplified, or breaking, gravity wave resembling a hydraulic jump to the lee of the two mountain ridges are found in lidar observations as well as in the simulations.

  abstract  = {Atmospheric transport models can be used to infer surface fluxes of atmospheric CO2 from observed concentrations using inverse methods. One of the main problem of these methods is the question of their sensivity to all the parameters involved in the calculation. In this paper we study precisely the influence of the main parameters on the net CO2 fluxes inferred by an annual Bayesian three-dimensional (3-D) inversion of atmospheric CO2 monthly concentrations. This inversion is described as the control inversion (S0) of Bousquet et al. [this issue]. Successively, at regional to global spatial scales we analyze the numerical stability of the solution to initial fluxes and errors, the influence of a priori flux scenario, the sensitivity to the atmospheric transport model used, the influence of 13C measurements, and the influence of the atmospheric network. We find that the atmospheric transport model introduces a large uncertainty to the inferred budget, which overcomes our control run uncertainties. The effects of vertical transport on CO2 concentrations appear to be a critical point that has to be investigated further. Spatial patterns of fluxes also have significant influence on a regional basis. We notice that accounting for the Baltic Sea station (BAL) deeply modifies the Europe versus Asia partition of the land uptake at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. We also analyze the weak influence of using 13C measurements as additional constraints. In the tropics we find that the low level of constraints imposed by the atmospheric network limits the analysis of fluxes to zonal means. Finally, we calculate overall estimates of CO2 net sources and sinks at continental scale, accounting for all sensivity tests. Concerning the controversial partition of CO2 sink at mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, we find (on average, for the 1985-1995 period) an overall partition of the sink of 0.7{$\pm$}0.7 Gt C/yr for North America, 0.2{$\pm$}0.3 Gt C/yr for the North Pacific Ocean, 0.5{$\pm$}0.8 Gt C/yr for Europe, 0.7{$\pm$}0.3 Gt C/yr for the North Atlantic Ocean, and 1.2{$\pm$}0.8 Gt C/yrfor north Asia. This overall partition tends to place an important land uptake over north Asia. However, uncertainties remain large when we account for all the sensitivity tests.},

  abstract  = {A primary goal of developing the CO2 atmospheric measurement network is to better characterize the sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2. Atmospheric transport models can be used to interpret atmospheric measurements in terms of surface fluxes using inverse methodology. In this paper we present a three-dimensional (3-D) inversion of CO2 measurements in order to infer annual sources and sinks of CO2 at a continental scale (continents and ocean basins) for a climatological year representing the 1985-1995 period. Solving this inverse problem requires (1) a data space representing monthly CO2 measurements, here at 77 sites (surface, ships, planes), (2) a flux space describing a priori fluxes between carbon reservoirs, and (3) a 3-D transport model linking the flux space to the data space. Knowledge of these three elements, together with their associated errors, allows one to reduce the uncertainties of the CO2 sources and sinks. In the 1985-1995 period, for our control inversion, the global continental sink is found to be 2.7{$\pm$}1.5 Gt C/yr for an optimized deforestation source of 1.4{$\pm$}0.6 Gt C/yr, yielding a net land uptake of 1.3{$\pm$}1.6 Gt C/yr (fossil fuel removed). The continental partition of this budget is (in units of Gt C/yr): Arctic +0.2{$\pm$}0.3, North America 0.5{$\pm$}0.6, Europe 0.3{$\pm$}0.8, north Asia 1.5{$\pm$}0.7, tropics (except Asia) +0.3{$\pm$}0.9, tropical Asia +0.8{$\pm$}0.4, and Southern Hemisphere 0.1{$\pm$}0.3. The inferred partition for the controversial Northern Hemisphere CO2 sink reveals that a major sink is located over the north Asia continent. For oceans we find a net global sink of 1.5{$\pm$}0.5 Gt C/yr with the following partition (in units of Gt C/yr): North Pacific 0.3{$\pm$}0.2, North Atlantic 0.8{$\pm$}0.3, equator +0.6{$\pm$}0.2, 20-50S oceans 0.9{$\pm$}0.3, and austral ocean 0.1{$\pm$}0.1.},

The system includes a three-dimensional mesoscale meteorological model (MESO), a Lagrangian particle dispersion (LPD) model, and an Eulerian grid dispersion (EGD) model based on numerical solution of K-theory advection-diffusion equations. These two dispersion models can be used separately, or they can be linked together as a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian dispersion model. The MDMS has been designed for use on personal computers and workstations. This paper provides a compact description of the present status of the modeling system and its applications. Numerical simulations performed for a complex region of the cast coast of the United States demonstrate two complementary approaches to air-pollution dispersion modeling available in the MDMS: traditional source-oriented modeling, and receptor-oriented modeling. },

  abstract  = {The time-space distribution of chlorophyll a in the southwestern Atlantic is examined using 6 years (1998-2003) of sea surface color images from Sea-viewing Wide Field of View Sensor (SeaWiFS). Chlorophyll a (chl a) distribution is confronted with sea surface temperature (SST) fronts retrieved from satellite imagery. Histogram analysis of the color, SST, and SST gradient data sets provides a simple procedure for pixel classification from which eight biophysical regions in the SWA are identified, including three new regions with regard to Longhurst (1998) work: Patagonian Shelf Break (PSB), Brazil Current Overshoot, and Zapiola Rise region. In the PSB region, coastal-trapped waves are suggested as a possible mechanism leading to the intraseasonal frequencies observed in SST and chl a. Mesoscale activity associated with the Brazil Current Front and, in particular, eddies drifting southward is probably responsible for the high chl a values observed throughout the Brazil Current Overshoot region. The Zapiola Rise is characterized by a local minimum in SST gradient magnitudes and shows chl a maximum values in February, 3 months later than the austral spring bloom of the surroundings. Significant interannual variability is present in the color imagery. In the PSB, springs and summers with high chl a concentrations seem associated with stronger local northerly wind speed, and possible mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the Brazil-Malvinas front is detected using both SST gradient and SeaWiFS images. The time-averaged position of the front at 54.2W is estimated at 38.9S and its alongshore migration of about 300 km.},

It is also the first survey in the region ever obtained in an austral summer. The austral summer 1990 atmospheric conditions were anomalously warm over the region. The surface waters were separated from the underlying waters by a thin and sharp seasonal thermocline which hid the real location of the Brazil-Malvinas thermocline front on infrared satellite imagery. The surface salinity was influenced by the large Rio de La Plata runoff which was anomalously high by a factor of 3. Salinity values less than 32 psu were encountered. These low salinity waters were entrained by the surface east-west front away from the coast. Four types of fronts were observed in the surface layer: (i) an east-west front associated with the structure of the seasonal thermocline separating cold, low salinity, oxygen supersaturated and productive waters to the south from warm, salty, weakly undersaturated and poor chlorophyll a waters to the north, (ii) a north-south front in salinity due to the outflow of the Rio de La Plata, (iii) a shelf break front between the shelf water and the Malvinas Water characterized by higher Chl a values, and (iv) a front between the Malvinas Water and the Brazil-Malvinas return flow.},

Departing from the dominant pattern of foraging on predictable bathymetric fronts on the Patagonian shelf and slope, three females out of 12 satellite-tracked juveniles remained at the edge of young warm-core eddies and near the outer core of cold-core eddies, coinciding with the most productive areas of these temperature fronts. Seal trajectories along high-temperature gradients were always consistent with the speed and direction of surface currents inferred from the temperature distribution and confirmed by surface drifters. Movements of foraging seals were compared with those of surface drifters, coinciding in time and space and yielding independent and consistent data on regional water circulation parameters. The diving pattern recorded for one focal seal yielded shallower dives and a loose diel pattern in the eddy, and a marked diurnal cycle compatible with foraging on vertically migrating prey in the cold waters of the Malvinas Current. Pre-reproductive females that use the mesoscale fronts of the Argentine Basin as an alternative foraging area would benefit from lower competition with more experienced seals and with other top predators that reproduce along the coast of Patagonia.},

  abstract  = {Present methods used to retrieve altimeter data do not provide reliable estimates of sea surface height (SSH) in the nearshore region, resulting in a measurement gap of 25-50 km next to the coast. In the present work, gridded SSH fields produced by Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data (AVISO) in the offshore region are combined with coastal tide gauge time series of SSH to improve estimation in that gap along the west coast of the United States in the northern California Current System between 40 and 45N and 123.8 and 126W. To assess the increase in skill provided by this procedure, the geostrophic alongshore currents, calculated from the new SSH fields in the gap region, are compared to three in situ, nearshore current measurements, resulting in correlation coefficients of 0.73-0.83 and standard deviations of the differences of 11.6-12.6 cm/s, substantially improved from the AVISO-only results. When the Ekman current components are estimated and added to the geostrophic currents, comparisons to the 10 m deep acoustic Doppler current profiler velocities are only slightly improved. The Ekman components make a more significant contribution when compared to HF radar surface current measurements, providing correlations of 0.94 and standard deviations of the differences of 6.4-9.5 cm/s. These results represent a dramatic improvement in the quality of the SSH fields and estimated alongshore currents when additional, realistic SSH data from the coastal region are added. Here we use coastal tide gauges to provide the additional SSH data but also discuss more general approaches for altimeter SSH retrievals in coastal regions where tide gauge data are not available.},

  abstract  = {Neritic fronts are very abundant in austral South America, covering several scales of space and time. However, this region is poorly studied from a systemic point of view. Our main goal is to develop a holistic view of physical and ecological patterns and processes at austral South America, regarding frontal arrangements. Satellite information (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration), and historical hydrographic data were employed to show fronts. We compiled all existing evidence (physical and biological) about fronts to identify regions defined by similar types of coastal fronts and to characterize them. Fronts in austral South America can be arranged in six zones according to their location, main forcing, key physical variables, seasonality, and enrichment mechanisms. Four zones, the Atlantic upwelling zone; the temperate estuarine zone; the Patagonian tidal zone and the Argentine shelf-break zone, occupy most of the Atlantic side. The Chile-Peru upwelling zone, on the Pacific, is the largest and best-known region. The Patagonian cold estuarine zone encompasses the tip of South America, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and remains poorly studied. When observed at a continental scale, the Pacific coast dominated by two large frontal zones appears simplest than the Atlantic coast in terms of frontal richness. The extension of the continental shelf in the Atlantic coast allows for the development of a great diversity of mesoscale fronts. Though frontal zones we defined are extensive areas of the continental shelves, fronts inside the zones are comparatively small areas. Even so, they play a paramount role in ecological processes, allowing for high biological production; offering feeding and/or reproductive habitats for fishes, squids, and birds; acting as retention areas for larvae of benthic species; and promoting establishment of benthic invertebrates that benefit from the organic production in the frontal area.},

A nonlinear model was used to fit the annual harmonic of the chlorophyll concentration anomalies in the region. Analysis of the spatial variability of model parameters has shown the existence of a marked annual cycle at several locations in the study region. We also have observed shorter-period oscillating features on smaller spatial scale, associated with the BMC dynamics. These mesoscale features have periods of about 9-12 weeks and have a marked northward propagation with higher chlorophyll values relative to the surrounding waters.},

It was not intended that the referenced information in this presentation be exhaustive, the bias has been placed on describing the measurement survey.
2.Due to commercial confidentiality, presentations of data measured during the survey have been limited to time series and statistics. However, the confidentiality of the data does not necessarily preclude use of the data for future research purposes.
3.The analysis of current, tide, wave, wind and meteorological data is described and the nature of mechanisms driving the current and wave regime are suggested.
4.Offshore oceanographic measurements were carried out at three locations prior to a drilling programme by the semi-submersible drilling rig Borgny Dolphin and on board whilst drilling. Meteorological measurements were performed at two locations on the Islands and on the Borgny Dolphin. Drifting buoys were deployed and conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) measurements were carried out to determine the position and intra-annual variation of the Falklands Current in the North Falklands Basin.
5.The primary oceanographic current flow features of this area are the Brazil and Falklands Currents, which meet at a confluence off the coasts of Argentina and Uruguay. The position of the front varies between approximately 30 and 40S, depending on changes in the relative strength of the two current systems. Current flows are stronger on the slope than on the Continental Shelf and are less tidally dominated. Although it is thought that the FOSA mooring locations were influenced by the margins of the Falklands Current, stronger flows have been reported to the north of the measurement location. Typical maximum recorded near-surface currents reached 0.8 m/s, with near-bed maxima reaching 0.55 m/s.
6.The wave climate was primarily driven by locally derived storms, resulting in events of short duration. Typical maximum significant wave heights of 8.9 and 9.4 m were recorded to the north and south of the Islands, respectively. Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The ocean-to-atmosphere heat budget of the West Antarctic Peninsula is controlled in part by the upward flux of heat from the warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) layer that resides below ~200 m to the Antarctic Surface Water (AASW), a water mass which varies strongly on a seasonal basis. Upwelling and mixing of CDW influence the formation of sea ice in the region and affect biological productivity and functioning of the ecosystem through their delivery of nutrients. In this study, 2.5-year time series of both Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data are used to quantify both the diapycnal diffusivity ?? and the vertical heat flux Q at the interface between CDW and AASW. Over the period of the study, a mean upward heat flux of ~1 W m???2 is estimated, with the largest heat fluxes occurring shortly after the loss of winter fast ice when the water column is first exposed to wind stress without being strongly stratified by salinity. Differences in mixing mechanisms between winter and summer seasons are investigated. Whilst tidally-driven mixing at the study site occurs year-round, but is likely to be relatively weak, a strong increase in counterclockwise-polarized near-inertial energy (and shear) is observed during the fast-ice-free season, suggesting that the direct impact of storms on the ocean surface is responsible for much of the observed mixing at the site. Given the rapid reduction in sea-ice duration in this region in the last 30 years, a shift towards an increasingly wind-dominated mixing regime may be taking place.},

  abstract  = {Taylors' frozen turbulence hypothesis suggests that all turbulent eddies are advected by the mean streamwise velocity, without changes in their properties. This hypothesis has been widely invoked to compute Reynolds averaging using temporal turbulence data measured at a single point in space. However, in the atmospheric surface layer, the exact relationship between convection velocity and wave number k has not been fully revealed since previous observations were limited by either their spatial resolution or by the sampling length. Using Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS), acquiring turbulent temperature fluctuations at high temporal and spatial frequencies, we computed convection velocities across wave numbers using a phase spectrum method. We found that convection velocity decreases as k???1/3 at the higher wave numbers of the inertial subrange instead of being independent of wave number as suggested by Taylor's hypothesis. We further corroborated this result using large eddy simulations. Applying Taylor's hypothesis thus systematically underestimates turbulent spectrum in the inertial subrange. A correction is proposed for point-based eddy-covariance measurements, which can improve surface energy budget closure and estimates of CO2 fluxes.},

  abstract      = {The representation of spatial wind distribution is recognized as a serious difficulty when modeling the hydrodynamics of lakes surrounded by a complex topography. To address this issue, we propose to force a 3-D lake model with the wind field simulated by a high-resolution atmospheric model, considering as a case study a 61 km2 prealpine lake surrounded by mountain ranges that reach 1800 m above the lake's surface, where a comprehensive data set was available in the stratified season. The improved distributed description of the wind stress over the lake surface led to a significant enhancement in the representation of the main basin-scale internal wave motions, and hence provided a reference solution to test the use of simplified approaches. Moreover, the analysis of the power exerted by the computed wind field enabled us to identify measuring stations that provide suitable wind data to be applied uniformly on the lake surface in long-term simulations. Accordingly, the proposed methodology can contribute to reducing the uncertainties associated with the definition of wind forcing for modeling purposes and can provide a rational criterion for installing representative measurement locations in prealpine lakes.},
