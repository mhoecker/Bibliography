  abstract = {Accurate and computationally-efficient modeling of stratified mixing
	processes are of paramount importance in both coastal and large-scale
	ocean circulation. In this study, our main objective is to investigate
	the feasibility and accuracy of large eddy simulation (LES) as a
	possible tool to study small-scale oceanic processes. To this end,
	LES is evaluated in a 3D lock-exchange problem, which contains shear-driven
	mixing, internal waves, interactions with boundaries and convective
	motions, while having a simple domain, initial and boundary conditions,
	and forcing. Two general classes of LES models are tested, namely
	eddy viscosity (EV) models based on constant-coefficient and dynamic
	Smagorinsky models, and an approximate deconvolution (AD) model.
	By noting that the dynamic Smagorinsky and AD models have different
	strengths in that the former is good in providing appropriate dissipation
	while the latter in preserving the detail of coherent structures
	on coarse resolution meshes, a hybrid approach combining EV and AD
	models is also evaluated. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) is
	performed as the benchmark solution, and all LES models are tested
	on three coarse meshes. The main measure of mixing is taken as the
	temporal evolution of background potential energy. It is found that
	constant-coefficient Smagorinsky models can only provide a marginal
	improvement over under-resolved simulations, while both dynamic Smagorinsky
	and AD models lead to significant improvements in mixing accuracy.
	The primary accomplishment of this study is that it is shown that
	the hybrid approach attains the best agreement with the mixing curve
	from DNS, while being computationally approximately a thousand times
	faster.},

	of suspended particles from spherical shape on the rotary motion
	of axisymmetric dipolar particles placed in a homogeneous shear flow
	are studied. The analysis shows that, owing to cumulative effects,
	even a weak external field or a small deviation from spherical shape
	can significantly modify the resulting motion relative to that found
	in the corresponding classical problems of torque-free particles
	or dipolar spheres in homogeneous shear. Thus, unlike the latter
	problems, there are in the present problem cases when all particles
	approach a single limit cycle; in other cases multiple stable equilibria
	simultaneously coexist and the orientation space is appropriately
	divided into corresponding domains of attraction; in some situations
	possessing appropriate symmetry properties, particles may, depending
	upon their respective initial orientations, either move along a family
	of periodic orbits or else converge to a stable equilibrium orientation.

	The motility of the organism is described by an average upward swimming
	speed U and a diffusivity tensor D. It is shown that the equilibrium
	suspension is unstable to infinitesimal perturbations when either
	the layer depth or the mean concentration of the organisms exceeds
	a critical value. For deep layers the maximum growth rate determines
	a preferred pattern size explicitly in terms of U and D. The results
	are compared with observations of patterns formed by the ciliated
	protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis. },

	destroyed as they achieve a maximum height and initiate collapse
	at a non-dimensional time of , where [Delta]U is the velocity shear

	the billow and time with and . After the collapse starts, however,
	the pertinent lengthscale ratios in the [`]core' of the billow show

  abstract = {Microscale variability of phytoplankton has been detected in vertical
	profiles in the ocean for decades, yet its mechanism of formation
	remains unclear. Here a mechanism is presented which can generate
	thin (10s of centimeters) layers of phytoplankton through the interaction
	of near-inertial wave shear with horizontal (along-isopycnal) patchiness
	of phytoplankton. Horizontal biomass patches along isopycnals are
	advected over each other by the vertical shear of near-inertial waves,
	generating layers in vertical profiles. The thickness of the phytoplankton
	layers can be much less than the vertical wavelength of the internal
	wave, due to tilting and stretching of horizontal patches of phytoplankton.
	The thickness of the layers is directly related to the vertical shear
	and the along-isopycnal scale of the phytoplankton patches: shorter
	horizontal scales generate thinner layers for a given shear. The
	amplitude of the biomass difference between layers is directly proportional
	to both the along-isopycnal and vertical biomass gradients. The model
	predicts the thickness, time of occurrence and duration of layers
	during the internal wave's cycle. This mechanism is likely a ubiquitous
	feature of the world's ocean, and would be particularly important
	in regions of strong horizontal gradients of properties.},

	shear flows to two-dimensional disturbances is described by the Taylor-Goldstein
	equation. Instability can only occur when the Richardson number is
	less than 1\&sol;4 somewhere in the flow. We consider cases where
	the Richardson number is everywhere non- negative. The eigenvalue
	problem is expressed in terms of four parameters, J a \&lsquo;typical\&rsquo;
	Richardson number, \&alpha; the (real) wavenumber and c the complex
	phase speed of the disturbance. Two computer programs are developed
	to integrate the stability equation and to solve for eigenvalues:
	the first finds c given \&alpha; and J, the second finds \&alpha;
	and J when c \&equiv; 0 (i.e. it computes the stationary neutral
	curve for the flow). This is sometimes, but not always, the stability
	boundary in the \&alpha;, J plane. The second program works only
	for cases where the velocity and density profiles are antisymmetric
	about the velocity inflexion point. By means of these two programs,
	several configurations of velocity and density have been investigated,
	both of the free-shear-layer type and the jet type. Calculations
	of temporal growth rates for particular profiles have been made.

  abstract = { When a suspension of bacterial cells of the species Bacillus subtilis
	is placed in a chamber with its upper surface open to the atmosphere
	complex bioconvection patterns are observed. These arise because
	the cells: (1) are denser than water; and (2) usually swim upwards,
	so that the density of an initially uniform suspension becomes greater
	at the top than the bottom. When the vertical density gradient becomes
	large enough, an overturning instability occurs which ultimately
	evolves into the observed patterns. The reason that the cells swim
	upwards is that they are aerotactic, i.e. they swim up gradients
	of oxygen, and they consume oxygen. These properties are incorporated
	in conservation equations for the cell (N) and oxygen (C) concentrations,
	and these are solved in the pre-instability phase of development
	when N and C depend only on the vertical coordinate and time. Numerical
	results are obtained for both shallow- and deep-layer chambers, which
	are intrinsically different and require different mathematical and
	numerical treatments. It is found that, for both shallow and deep
	chambers, a thin boundary layer, densely packed with cells, forms
	near the surface. Beneath this layer the suspension becomes severely
	depleted of cells. Furthermore, in the deep chamber cases, a discontinuity
	in the cell concentration arises between this cell-depleted region
	and a cell-rich region further below, where no significant oxygen
	concentration gradients develop before the oxygen is fully consumed.
	The results obtained from the model are in good qualitative agreement
	with the experimental observations.},

	preferentially in downwelling regions, cancelling its upward swimming
	motion. In the braids that separate the billows, intense shear defeats
	the gyrotactic stabilization mechanism and causes cells to tumble.
	Particle and continuum models are compared statistically to reveal
	both consistencies and weaknesses in each. A scaling based on Reynolds
	number and swimming speed is used to predict the maximum concentration
	generated by an instability event. Although K-H billows are short
	lived in comparison with planktonic thin layers observed in the coastal
	oceans, the resulting trapping causes rapid aggregation. We conclude

	by first determining Hamilton's principle for the \{CL\} equations.
	The \{CL\} Hamilton's principle is similar to that for a fluid plasma,
	driven by a rapidly varying external electromagnetic field via ``J
	 A'' minimal coupling, after averaging the plasma action over the
	fast phase of the (single frequency) driving field. This similarity
	leads to a precise analogy between the \{CL\} vortex force and the
	Lorentz force on an electrically charged fluid due to an exernally
	imposed electromagnetic field. We determine the effect of this force
	on the inflection point criterion and the Richardson number criterion
	for stability of planar \{CL\} flows. The Noether symmetries of Hamilton's
	principle for the \{CL\} equations (under fluid particle relabeling)
	lead to conservation laws for Eulerian mean potential vorticity and
	helicity, and generate the steady Eulerian mean flows as canonical
	transformations. The generalized Lagrangian mean theory is discussed
	from the same viewpoint.},

	three-dimensional movement of 64 or 27 identical squirmers in a fluid
	otherwise at rest, contained in a cube with periodic boundary conditions,
	is dynamically computed, for random initial positions and orientations.
	The computation utilizes a database of pairwise interactions that
	has been constructed by the boundary element method. In the case
	of (non-bottom-heavy) squirmers, both the translational and the orientational
	spreading of squirmers is correctly described as a diffusive process
	over a sufficiently long time scale, even though all the movements
	of the squirmers were deterministically calculated. Scaling of the
	results on the assumption that the squirmer trajectories are unbiased
	random walks is shown to capture some but not all of the main features
	of the results. In the case of (bottom-heavy) squirmers, the diffusive
	behaviour in squirmers' orientations can be described by a biased
	random walk model, but only when the effect of hydrodynamic interaction
	dominates that of the bottom-heaviness. The spreading of bottom-heavy
	squirmers in the horizontal directions show diffusive behaviour,
	and that in the vertical direction also does when the average upward
	velocity is subtracted. The rotational diffusivity in this case,
	at a volume fraction c=0.1, is shown to be at least as large as that
	previously measured in very dilute populations of swimming algal
	cells (Chlamydomonas nivalis). },

  abstract = {Measurements of acoustic scattering from zooplankton and oceanic microstructure
	using a broadband echosounder. - ICES Journal of Marine Science,
	67: 379?394. In principle, measurements of high-frequency acoustic
	scattering from oceanic microstructure and zooplankton across a broad
	range of frequencies can reduce the ambiguities typically associated
	with the interpretation of acoustic scattering at a single frequency
	or a limited number of discrete narrowband frequencies. With this
	motivation, a high-frequency broadband scattering system has been
	developed for investigating zooplankton and microstructure, involving
	custom modifications of a commercially available system, with almost
	complete acoustic coverage spanning the frequency range 150?600 kHz.
	This frequency range spans the Rayleigh-to-geometric scattering transition
	for some zooplankton, as well as the diffusive roll-off in the spectrum
	for scattering from turbulent temperature microstructure. The system
	has been used to measure scattering from zooplankton and microstructure
	in regions of non-linear internal waves. The broadband capabilities
	of the system provide a continuous frequency response of the scattering
	over a wide frequency band, and improved range resolution and signal-to-noise
	ratios through pulse-compression signal-processing techniques. System
	specifications and calibration procedures are outlined and the system
	performance is assessed. The results point to the utility of high-frequency
	broadband scattering techniques in the detection, classification,
	and under certain circumstances, quantification of zooplankton and
	microstructure.},

  abstract = { To investigate the formation mechanism of energy spectra of internal
	waves in the oceans, direct numerical simulations are performed.
	The simulations are based on the reduced dynamical equations of rotating
	stratified turbulence. In the reduced dynamical equations only wave
	modes are retained, and vortices and horizontally uniform vertical
	shears are excluded. Despite the simplifications, our simulations
	reproduce some key features of oceanic internal-wave spectra: accumulation
	of energy at near-inertial waves and realistic frequency and horizontal
	wavenumber dependencies. Furthermore, we provide evidence that formation
	of the energy spectra in the inertial subrange is dominated by scale-separated
	interactions with the near-inertial waves. These findings support
	observationally based intuition that spectral energy density of internal
	waves is the result of predominantly wave-wave interactions.},

  abstract = { In his landmark paper of 1883, Reynolds addressed the question of
	why the fluid motion along a pipe changes from a laminar to a turbulent
	state at modest flow rates. His discoveries have remained a focus
	of hydrodynamic stability for the intervening 125 years, and the
	central puzzle of why the transition takes place at all remains unresolved.
	It is an enigma as all theoretical and numerical evidence suggests
	that the base state of fully developed flow, Hagen-Poiseuille flow,
	is linearly stable. The transition to turbulence is abrupt, mysterious,
	and largely dependent on the quality of the facility used in any
	experimental investigation. It is therefore not an example of transition
	via a sequence of instabilities or bifurcations in which considerable
	success has been achieved over the same period. Despite wide-ranging
	research activity that has uncovered many important pieces of the
	jigsaw, the central puzzle remains unresolved. The purpose of this
	review is to bring together the available experimental evidence and
	attempt to extract a set of accepted facts about this important problem.

  journal = {Journal of Fluid Mechanics},
  year = {1988},
  volume = {195},
  pages = {223--237},
  abstract = { ABSTRACT `Bioconvection' is the name given to pattern-forming convective
	motions set up in suspensions of swimming micro-organisms. `Gyrotaxis'
	describes the way the swimming is guided through a balance between
	the physical torques generated by viscous drag and by gravity operating
	on an asymmetric distribution of mass within the organism. When the
	organisms are heavier towards the rear, gyrotaxis turns them so that
	they swim towards regions of most rapid downflow. The presence of
	gyrotaxis means that bioconvective instability can develop from an
	initially uniform suspension, without an unstable density stratification.
	In this paper a continuum model for suspensions of gyrotactic micro-organisms
	is proposed and discussed; in particular, account is taken of the
	fact that the organisms of interest are non-spherical, so that their
	orientation is influenced by the strain rate in the ambient flow
	as well as the vorticity. This model is used to analyse the linear
	instability of a uniform suspension. It is shown that the suspension
	is unstable if the disturbance wavenumber is less than a critical
	value which, together with the wavenumber of the most rapidly growing
	disturbance, is calculated explicitly. The subsequent convection
	pattern is predicted to be three-dimensional (i.e. with variation
	in the vertical as well as the horizontal direction) if the cells
	are sufficiently elongated. Numerical results are given for suspensions
	of a particular algal species (Chlamydomonas nivalis); the predicted
	wavelength of the most rapidly growing disturbance is 5\&ndash;6
	times larger than the wavelength of steady-state patterns observed
	in experiments. The main reasons for the difference are probably
	that the analysis describes the onset of convection, not the final,
	nonlinear steady state, and that the experimental fluid layer has
	finite depth. },

  year = {2007},

  number = {C9},
  abstract = {The influence of surface waves and an applied wind stress is studied
	in an ensemble of large eddy simulations to investigate the nature
	of deeply penetrating jets into an unstratified mixed layer. The
	influence of a steady monochromatic surface wave propagating parallel
	to the wind direction is parameterized using the wave-filtered Craik-Leibovich
	equations. Tracer trajectories and instantaneous downwelling velocities
	reveal classic counterrotating Langmuir rolls. The associated downwelling
	jets penetrate to depths in excess of the wave's Stokes depth scale,
	$\delta_\text{s}$. Qualitative evidence suggests the depth of the
	jets is controlled by the Ekman depth scale. Analysis of turbulent
	kinetic energy (tke) budgets reveals a dynamical distinction between
	Langmuir turbulence and shear-driven turbulence. In the former, tke
	production is dominated by Stokes shear and a vertical flux term
	transports tke to a depth where it is dissipated. In the latter,
	tke production is from the mean shear and is locally balanced by
	dissipation. We define the turbulent Langmuir number Lat = (v*/Us)0.5
	(v* is the ocean's friction velocity and Us is the surface Stokes
	drift velocity) and a turbulent anisotropy coefficient Rt = /( +
	). The transition between shear-driven and Langmuir turbulence is
	investigated by varying external wave parameters $\delta_\text{s}$
	and Lat and by diagnosing Rt and the Eulerian mean and Stokes shears.
	When either Lat or $\delta_\text{s}$ are sufficiently small the Stokes
	shear dominates the mean shear and the flow is preconditioned to
	Langmuir turbulence and the associated deeply penetrating jets.},

	were obtained during the month-long COARE Enhanced Monitoring cruise
	with a microstructure sensor system mounted on the bow of the research
	vessel. The vibration contamination was cancelled with the Wiener
	filter. The experimental technique provides an effective separation
	between surface waves and turbulence, using the difference in spatial
	scales of the energy-containing surface waves and small-scale turbulence.
	The data are interpreted in the coordinate system fixed to the ocean
	surface. Under moderate and high wind-speed conditions, we observed
	the average dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy in the
	upper few meters of the ocean to be 3-20 times larger than the logarithmic
	layer prediction. The Craig and Banner (J. Phys. Oceanogr. 24 (1994)
	2546) model of wave-enhanced turbulence with the surface roughness
	length from the water side z0 parameterized according to the Terray
	et al. (J. Phys. Oceanogr. 26 (1996) 792) formula z0=cHs provides
	a reasonable fit to the experimental dissipation profile, where z
	is the depth (defined here as the distance to the ocean surface),
	c[approximate]0.6, and Hs is the significant wave height. In the
	wave-stirred layer, however, the average dissipation profile deviates
	from the model (supposedly because of extensive removing of the bubble-disturbed
	areas close to the ocean surface). Though the scatter of individual
	experimental dissipation rates (10-min averages) is significant,
	their statistics are consistent with the Kolmogorov's concept of
	intermittent turbulence and with previous studies of turbulence in
	the upper ocean mixed layer.},

  volume = {296},
  pages = {73--126},
  abstract = {In a stably stratified shear layer, thin vorticity layers (&lsquo;baroclinic
	layers&rsquo;) are produced by buoyancy effects and strain in between
	the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz vortices. A two-dimensional numerical
	study is conducted, in order to investigate the stability of these
	layers. Besides the secondary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz instability,
	expected but never observed previously in two-dimensional numerical
	simulations, a new instability is also found.The influence of the
	Reynolds number (Re) upon the dynamics of the baroclinic layers is
	first studied. The layers reach an equilibrium state, whose features
	have been described theoretically by Corcos &amp; Sherman (1976).
	An excellent agreement between those predictions and the results
	of the numerical simulations is obtained. The baroclinic layers are
	found to remain stable almost up to the time the equilibrium state
	is reached, though the local Richardson number can reach values as
	low as 0.05 at the stagnation point. On the basis of the work of
	Dritschel et al. (1991), we show that the stability of the layer
	at this location is controlled by the outer strain field induced
	by the large-scale Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz vortices. Numerical values
	of the strain rate as small as 3% of the maximum vorticity of the
	layer are shown to stabilize the stagnation point region.When non-pairing
	flows are considered, we find that only for Re &le; 2000 does a secondary
	instability eventually amplify in the layer. (Re is based upon half
	the initial vorticity thickness and half the velocity difference
	at the horizontally oriented boundaries.) This secondary instability
	is not of the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz type. It develops in the neighbourhood
	of convectively unstable regions of the primary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz
	vortex, apparently once a strong jet has formed there, and moves
	along the baroclinic layer while amplifying. It next perturbs the
	layer around the stagnation point and a secondary instability, now
	of the Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz type, is found to develop there.We
	next examine the influence of a pairing upon the flow behaviour.
	We show that this event promotes the occurrence of a secondary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz
	instability, which occurs for Re &ge; 400. Moreover, at high Reynolds
	number (&ge; 2000), secondary Kelvin&ndash;Helmholtz instabilities
	develop successively in the baroclinic layer, at smaller and smaller
	scales, thereby transferring energy towards dissipative scales through
	a mechanism eventually leading to turbulence. Because the vorticity
	of such a two-dimensional stratified flow is no longer conserved
	following a fluid particle, an analogy with three-dimensional turbulence
	can be drawn.},

  abstract = {In the summer of 2007, a biophysical experiment was conducted to identify
	physical processes that determine the delivery of invertebrate larvae
	and juvenile rockfish to rocky intertidal and kelp forest communities
	in northern Monterey Bay, California. The experiment was sponsored
	by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans
	(PISCO) and collected physical measurements including velocity from
	acoustic Doppler current profilers, surface gravity wave heights
	measured acoustically, and temperature from thermistor chain arrays
	both along- and across- the inner shelf in water depths of 10 --
	60 m. The inner shelf is the transition between the nearshore and
	mid-shelf zones, and is defined where surface and bottom Ekman boundary
	layers overlap. Previous work has shown that the inner shelf in this
	region is rich in physical processes across many space and time scales.
	The goal here is to identify and quantify the dominant processes
	at the diurnal (24 hour) period. Diurnal tides contribute less than
	10\% of the observed currents. Thus the focus is on the oceanic response
	to a strong (8 - 15 m/s daily maximum) along-shelf sea breeze which
	forces offshore surface Ekman transport, drives average upwelling
	velocities of 26 m/day, and cools the water column 2 -- 4 degrees/day.
	At 15 m (20 m) depth, measured diurnal surface transport is 36\%
	 9\% (77\%  12\%) of full theoretical Ekman transport. Examination
	of a diurnal heat budget shows that vertical advection is the dominant
	process during afternoon cooling (both horizontal advection and solar
	insolation are sources of heat during this period), and is needed
	to close the heat budget to within 5\%. In contrast, during evening/early
	morning heating 92\% of the observed heating is explained by along-shelf
	advection of a temperature gradient within the upwelling shadow,
	much greater than the heating attributed to either solar insolation
	(2\%) or onshore motions (2\%). Thus, the diurnal heat budget is
	closed to within a few percent and explained by two-dimensional processes:
	vertical advection by wind-driven upwelling during cooling and along-shelf
	advection during heating.},

	billows may be irregularly spaced, resulting in pairing along their
	length, or, more commonly, grow at different rates in patches which
	subsequently amalgamate. Both processes result in features described
	as ?knots?, where neighbouring billows join. The tangling of billow
	vortices in the knots leads to local turbulence and mixing, often
	before turbulence develops at a smaller scale within the billows
	themselves. The axial coherence length of billows is limited to the
	along-axis distance between these knots. Such features in the atmosphere
	and the ocean have received little attention in spite of their possible
	bearing on clear-air turbulence and to heat and momentum transport.
	Observations of atmospheric billows suggest an axial coherence length
	which is of the same order as that found in the laboratory, about
	four billow wavelengths.},

	Boussinesq fluid flows is discussed. The concept of gravitational
	available potential energy is used to formulate an energy budget
	in which the evolution of the background potential energy, i.e. the
	minimum potential energy attainable through adiabatic motions, can
	be explicitly examined. For closed systems, the background potential
	energy can change only due to diabatic processes. The rate of change
	of background potential energy is proportional to the molecular diffusivity.
	Changes in the background potential energy provide a direct measure
	of the potential energy changes due to irreversible diapycnal mixing.
	For open systems, background potential energy can also change due
	to boundary fluxes, which can be explicitly measured. The analysis
	is particularly appropriate for evaluation of diabatic mixing rates
	in numerical simulations of turbulent flows. The energetics of a
	shear driven mixing layer is used to illustrate the analysis.},
